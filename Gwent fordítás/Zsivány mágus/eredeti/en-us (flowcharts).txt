adventure.flowchart_event5_tavern.dialogstory.7;You overhear two distraught looking young men⁠—treasure hunters, judging by their equipment⁠—discussing some elven ruins they discovered in the valley.\n\n'... those glyphs are making us run in circles.

You stop listening before you slip into a coma. Thankfully your meal arrives decidedly vegetable-free.
adventure.flowchart_event5_tavern.gossip.2;You can't help but notice an extremely drunk peasant bragging about his fortune.\n\n'The wishing well did it again. Threw in me wedding band two moons past, now me orchard's in full blossom. Not a lick o' the ol' rot. Next moon t'was me wife's golden Melitele figurine, now all me cows are carryin'. Now last night I tossed in her mother's necklace, and, wouldn't you believe it, the ol' hag finally up and left me. Ha! Blessins all 'round.'\n\nYou sigh, and ponder whether such folks are really worth saving.
adventure.flowchart_event5_tavern.gossip.3;The door is nudged open and you witness a trio of young women, dressed in the traditional azures and violets of Aretuza, making their way in. One of them, you notice, is unconscious, looking as though she'd been struck by lightning.\n\n'Told her she shouldn't be touching that thing. Those places of power are charged like the hells.'\n\nAs they sit her down in a booth, you eye the pendant hanging around her neck: it shudders and glows brightly, as if some sort of pent up energy is trying desperately to escape.\n\nFor the next hour, your mind floats somewhere between crystal vessels and spoonfuls of porridge.
adventure.flowchart_event5_tavern.gossip.4;You notice a sallow, decrepit priestess of an unknown deity, who had been sitting nearby, still and quiet as a grave. She takes notice of you, gets up to approach your table, and hoarsely croaks a message for your ears only.\n\n'I know of you, Alzur. Think to create life from death? Perhaps. But first you must learn the creation of undeath. Seek out the necromancer's tome, then bring it to the resting place of a mighty hero. There you can prove yourself.'\n\nShe then leaves, and you are left pondering matters of necromancy.
adventure.flowchart_event5_tavern.gossip.5;A man sits on a stool near the hearth, staring blankly into the flames and mumbling to himself.

The rabid bastards. The foul beasts! They snatched my girl, my … beautiful … girl … they … Oh, gods …' His words turn into unintelligible sobs.\n\nFeeling it’s best to leave the man to it, you return to your booth. For the rest of the night, your mind returns to thoughts of monsters, and what it will take to finally be rid of them.
adventure.flowchart_event5_tavern.gossip.6;Suddenly, the front doors swing open, letting in an ominous gust of wind. Everyone falls silent and turns towards the rhythmic clink of sabatons on floorboards as a Chapter Herald enters the tavern, holding a bundle of papers under his arm.\n\nHe scans the room, oblivious to your presence in the shady confines of the far corner, then strides forward and nails a 'WANTED!' poster depicting your likeness to a wooden beam.\n\nAfter the Herald leaves, the innkeeper strolls over, tears down the bounty, and throws a subtle nod your way. You smile. Looks like the Chapter isn't making too many friends around these parts. You order a goblet of the innkeeper's finest and try to enjoy the rest of your evening.
adventure.flowchart_event5_tavern.gossip.7;Your attempts to eavesdrop are interrupted by a self-appointed bard taking stage on a table with a badly damaged lute. As he clears his throat in preparation, one of the patrons recognizes his great blond mustached mug and tosses a tankard at the bard, starting a riot.\n\nAfter he's forced to flee⁠—with a small mob in pursuit⁠—a relative calm returns to the tavern, and you are able to begin your meal in peace.
adventure.flowchart_event5_tavern.gossip.8;A couple of rowdy dwarves scream obscenities at one another as they slam down cards on a table nearby.

adventure.flowchart_event6_wintersolstice.dialogstory.1;You take the bowl and nod. You've never been one to reject the hospitality of others, especially when so many of them are glaring at you.\n\nYou stare into the simmering liquid, the star-speckled sky reflecting upon its dark sheen.

flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_23;Until my dying breath. I will push on.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_24;Every setback feeds the furnace. Every failure fuels the flame.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_25;Beaten. But not broken.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_26;The day will come, Lilly. The day will come.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_27;All these fools from the Chapter would be delighted to see me fail. I will not grant them the satisfaction.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_28;Once more unto the breach.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_29;I need a better plan. Just you wait.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_3;We need a pure mutagen. How many times did we fail with inferior ingredients?
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_30;Proud of yourself, you sassy bastard? Hang on there. I'll be back.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_31;Is this all for naught? Oh, Lilly. How could I be so blind?
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_32;I'll squeeze my answers out of them.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_33;My sweet Lilly... I'm glad you don't have to see this.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_34;Patience. Patience.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_35;There is no effort without error and shortcoming.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_36;Swing back to gather momentum. Just like a battering ram.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_37;She was my strength and my reason. Now I'm just a blundering fool.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_38;I was simply out of focus.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_39;Let's try another formula. Maybe... Triangle Within Triangle.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_4;Don't overthink it, my dear.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_40;If I got an oren for every foolish hurdle, I'd be wealthier than the king of Ofir.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_41;Well, if it was easy, someone would have done it before me.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_42;A lapse of concentration. That's all.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_43;Decay permeates the ground. The beast is near. I feel its rotten breath.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_44;A perfect sample, but I'm not done yet.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_45;Only one more mutagen to go.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_46;The earth is scorched, the wind brings ash. The fiend is nigh.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_47;You... You ripped out my heart, beast. I cannot punish you enough in a thousand years. But I'll try my best.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_48;My greatest mistake. Today it gets undone.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_49;The man in the mirror will be disgusted with me, if I don't see this through.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_5;The energy flowing through the veins beneath such stones can be traced back to the Conjunction.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_50;Lilly, guide my hand.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_51;I won't rest as long as you draw breath.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_52;You taught me the meaning of grief. I'll teach you the meaning of horror.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_53;Humiliated by my own misbegotten creation. This will not stand!
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_54;Must I relive this failure, again and again?
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_55;When I face that abomination, I see you dying, Lilly. And I'm paralyzed...
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_56;Next time, I'll rip it to shreds. I swear by the thunder.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_57;Outsmarted by a hulk of mutated meat. I won't be remembered like that.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_58;I created you, vile creature. And rest assured, I can destroy you as well.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_59;It is done, Lilly. The research complete, your vision realized.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_6;It would seem we are approaching the dragon's roost.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_60;But the price we paid... If I knew from the outset... I'm not sure I would embrace that burden.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_61;I feel we began something greater than ourselves. A legacy.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_62;So I can't help but to wonder... What happens when it's out of my hands?
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_63;And then...I tremble.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_64;Scurry off, Chapter vermin! Return to your short-sighted oligarchs! I will not be bound by their inane regulations!
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_65;And tell Stammelford my arse is ripe for the kissing!
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_66;Damn the heavens. This hornet of a woman is truly relentless.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_67;Mind and muscle should go hand in hand. Brawn without brains is a recipe for failure.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_68;Haunted by my own mistake, over and over. A worthy penance.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_69;One day I will erase it for good. I promise you, Lilly.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_7;Lucky? That misbegotten creature is lucky. Not for long, though.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_70;Find a job. Scum.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_71;And maybe take a bath!
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_72;As the saying goes: best man wins. A valiant effort on his part, nevertheless.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_73;That's what happens when you bring puppies to a punch-up.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_74;A tall challenge. Almost up to my belt buckle.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_75;A lingering imprint of a lifeforce long gone.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_76;So much knowledge and drive gone to waste. I wish we met before his sanity faded.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_77;To herd sapient beings like cattle... Abominable.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_78;A knife. Hah! What am I, a loaf of bread?
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_79;It pains me to see a man of purpose, twisted and corrupted by the path he chose. I bet he didn't even see his own downfall.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_8;A grudge to be settled.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_80;These runes... However obscure, it's a curious branch of occult inquiry. No match for the High Art, though.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_81;The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_82;Its resin must be infused with powerful magic. A useful ingredient, no doubt. 
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_83;Necromancy, a forbidden art. And for a good reason.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_84;Most rules of the Chapter are just foolish... But some happen to be wise.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_85;And now they employ the methods of religious fanatics. The Chapter have reached a new low.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_86;The Chapter must think very little of me.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_87;To send this... This glorified ratcatcher my way. Insulting. 
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_88;Does the Chapter buy these fools by the dozen?  Truth be told, their agents are getting better.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_89;To face the bloodkin in combat and live to tell the tale... Truly a testament to my skill. And luck, let's be honest.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_9;Other than my pride?
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_90;The Lionhead Spider is a beauty compared to the sad monstrosity worshiped by this madman. Whatever this thing is, I don't care to know.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_91;Most intriguing creature. When I'm done with my opus magnum, I might obtain one of these. To study its... Unique skills.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_92;Such a simple brute... Yet there was nobility in his relentless spirit. I can admire that.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_93;Weak minds crumble when touched by magic. Poor, wretched man. Can't let his wailing influence my judgment.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_94;Your pathethic magic is only fit for scaring children at bedtime. Rest forgotten, witch.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_95;Now THIS is a force of nature. How it drew upon the power of the intersection... Effortless!
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_96;Fierce, primeval magic! If only I had a spare lifetime to study it!
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_97;Ugh. Progress demands sacrifice, I guess. Apparently sometimes you need to sacrifice your boots. And cloak. And breeches. 
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_98;With thunder and ice we shall battle, and it will be as the end of the world!
flowchartversioned_dialogue_alzur_99;Magnificent creature.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_lilly_1;Ambush! I knew this road wasn't safe!
flowchartversioned_dialogue_lilly_10;Anything hurt?
flowchartversioned_dialogue_lilly_11;I can't imagine anything putting a dent in your pride.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_lilly_12;We'll come better prepared.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_lilly_13;Back to the drawing board, then.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_lilly_14;A school of life indeed.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_lilly_15;You mean: human subjects.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_lilly_16;You scare me at times.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_lilly_17;Calm down, dear. They will see that we are in the right one day. This is why we must remain focused.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_lilly_18;Don't be so harsh, love. Maybe she had a rough upbringing.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_lilly_19;Leave us alone, you ... you rogue!
flowchartversioned_dialogue_lilly_2;The sun is out, yet the air feels cold.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_lilly_20;It is, truly. I'd much rather capture its beauty than take its life.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_lilly_3;A mother looking after her children is hardly a monster, is it?
flowchartversioned_dialogue_lilly_4;I know, but... When you chase the dream for so long, it is easy to lose sight of the principles that guided us in the first place.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_lilly_5;See how my pendant trembles? Yet, there were no monsters in sight around that stone.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_lilly_6;Is it snowing? Huh.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_lilly_7;The blizzard will hit us hard at the summit. I hope we are prepared.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_lilly_8;We're lucky we got away in one piece.
flowchartversioned_dialogue_lilly_9;A lesson to be learned.
