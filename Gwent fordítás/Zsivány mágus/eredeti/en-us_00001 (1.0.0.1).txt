adventure_battle_hint_1;Playing a card later in the round decreases the risk of it being destroyed.
adventure_battle_hint_10;You can evolve your Key Card by defeating Elite enemies.
adventure_battle_hint_11;You won’t encounter a Boss you’ve already harvested a mutagen from until you conduct an experiment.
adventure_battle_hint_12;Treasures can swing the battle in your favor. Discover powerful combos to unlock their full potential.
adventure_battle_hint_13;You must play at the highest available difficulty in order to find mutagens.
adventure_battle_hint_14;Don’t be afraid to lose—it’s a part of the game.
adventure_battle_hint_15;If the game is posing too much of a challenge, try the Archmage mode.
adventure_battle_hint_16;Transforming a card removes its statuses.
adventure_battle_hint_17;If you don’t like the post-battle rewards, try re-rolling them.
adventure_battle_hint_18;It’s a good idea to plan your path.
adventure_battle_hint_19;You can enable 'early pass' in the gameplay options. It will let you pass with cards still in your hand.
adventure_battle_hint_2;Don't be afraid to use your Energy.
adventure_battle_hint_20;You can change the tooltips display duration for cards played by your opponent in the gameplay options.

adventure_battle_hint_33;Aim for a balanced selection of Spells. Choosing three expensive ones is rarely a good idea.
adventure_battle_hint_34;It’s wise to spread boosts evenly among your units. Heavily boosting one card is a risky strategy.
adventure_battle_hint_35;You won’t meet an opponent more than once in a single run.
adventure_battle_hint_36;It’s always a good idea to have some cards that will let you disrupt your enemy’s game plan.

adventure_dialogue_alzur_1;They are no match for us. I'll scatter them, cover me, Lilly!
adventure_dialogue_alzur_10;You are a healing salve, Lilly.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_100;A fire that burns a hundred times as bright is decidedly short-lived.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_101;Oh, the nightmares you’d fuel, you foul thing!
adventure_dialogue_alzur_102;Let's see what you're made of, beautiful.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_11;A temporary setback.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_12;Let's eat first. I can't think on an empty stomach.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_13;That was... An illuminating experience.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_14;Next time I'll do the teaching.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_15;We've got the ingredients. Now we need the brewing pot.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_16;What else would I mean?
adventure_dialogue_alzur_17;My dear Lilly... I'm a husk without you.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_18;Our memories, our cause... It's all I have left now.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_19;I won't fail you again. I'll make your vision come true, no matter the cost.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_2;The ice dragon just arrived in the valley, likely bringing food for her young.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_20;Her life, our love... Lost in vain, if I give up now.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_21;…
adventure_dialogue_alzur_22;This is nothing. Nothing!
adventure_dialogue_alzur_23;Until my dying breath. I will push on.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_24;Every setback feeds the furnace. Every failure fuels the flame.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_25;Beaten. But not broken.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_26;The day will come, Lilly. The day will come.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_27;All these fools from the Chapter would be delighted to see me fail. I will not grant them the satisfaction.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_28;Once more unto the breach.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_29;I need a better plan. Just you wait.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_3;We need a pure mutagen. How many times did we fail with inferior ingredients?
adventure_dialogue_alzur_30;Proud of yourself, you sassy bastard? Hang on there. I'll be back.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_31;Is this all for naught? Oh, Lilly. How could I be so blind?
adventure_dialogue_alzur_32;I'll squeeze my answers out of them.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_33;My sweet Lilly... I'm glad you don't have to see this.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_34;Patience. Patience.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_35;There is no effort without error and shortcoming.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_36;Swing back to gather momentum. Just like a battering ram.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_37;She was my strength and my reason. Now I'm just a blundering fool.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_38;I was simply out of focus.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_39;Let's try another formula. Maybe... Triangle Within Triangle.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_4;Don't overthink it, my dear.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_40;If I got an oren for every foolish hurdle, I'd be wealthier than the king of Ofir.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_41;Well, if it was easy, someone would have done it before me.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_42;A lapse of concentration. That's all.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_43;Decay permeates the ground. The beast is near. I feel its rotten breath.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_44;A perfect sample, but I'm not done yet.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_45;Only one more mutagen to go.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_46;The earth is scorched, the wind brings ash. The fiend is nigh.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_47;You... You ripped out my heart, beast. I cannot punish you enough in a thousand years. But I'll try my best.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_48;My greatest mistake. Today it gets undone.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_49;The man in the mirror will be disgusted with me, if I don't see this through.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_5;The energy flowing through the veins beneath such stones can be traced back to the Conjunction.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_50;Lilly, guide my hand.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_51;I won't rest as long as you draw breath.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_52;You taught me the meaning of grief. I'll teach you the meaning of horror.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_53;Humiliated by my own misbegotten creation. This will not stand!
adventure_dialogue_alzur_54;Must I relive this failure, again and again?
adventure_dialogue_alzur_55;When I face that abomination, I see you dying, Lilly. And I'm paralyzed...
adventure_dialogue_alzur_56;Next time, I'll rip it to shreds. I swear by the thunder.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_57;Outsmarted by a hulk of mutated meat. I won't be remembered like that.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_58;I created you, vile creature. And rest assured, I can destroy you as well.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_59;It is done, Lilly. The research complete, your vision realised.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_6;It would seem we are approaching the dragon's roost.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_60;But the price we paid... If I knew from the outset... I'm not sure I would embrace that burden.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_61;I feel we began something greater than ourselves. A legacy.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_62;So I can't help but to wonder... What happens when it's out of my hands?
adventure_dialogue_alzur_63;And then...I tremble.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_64;Scurry off, Chapter vermin! Return to your short-sighted oligarchs! I will not be bound by their inane regulations!
adventure_dialogue_alzur_65;And tell Stammelford my arse is ripe for the kissing!
adventure_dialogue_alzur_66;Damn the heavens. This hornet of a woman is truly relentless.

adventure_dialogue_alzur_7;Lucky? That misbegotten creature is lucky. Not for long, though.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_70;Find a job. Scum.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_71;As the saying goes: best man wins. A valiant effort on his part, nevertheless.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_72;That's what happens when you bring puppies to a punch-up.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_73;A tall challenge. Almost up to my belt buckle.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_74;A lingering imprint of a lifeforce long gone.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_75;So much knowledge and drive gone to waste. I wish we met before his sanity faded.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_76;To herd sapient beings like cattle... Abominable.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_77;A knife. Phew! What am I, a loaf of bread?
adventure_dialogue_alzur_78;It pains me to see a man of purpose, twisted and corrupted by the path he chose. I bet he didn't even see his own downfall.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_79;These runes... However obscure, it's a curious branch of occult inquiry. No match for the High Art, though.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_8;A grudge to be settled.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_80;The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_81;Its resin must be infused with powerful magic. A useful ingredient, no doubt.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_82;Necromancy, a forbidden art. And for a good reason.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_83;Most rules of the Chapter are just foolish... But some happen to be wise.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_84;And now they employ the methods of religious fanatics. The Chapter have reached a new low.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_85;The Chapter must think very little of me.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_86;To send this... This glorified ratcatcher my way. Insulting.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_87;Does the Chapter buy these fools by the dozen?  Truth be told, their agents are getting better.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_88;To face the bloodkin in combat and live to tell the tale... Truly a testament to my skill. And luck, let's be honest.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_89;The Lionhead Spider is a beauty compared to the sad monstrosity worshiped by this madman. Whatever this thing is, I don't care to know.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_9;Other than my pride?
adventure_dialogue_alzur_90;Most intriguing creature. When I'm done with my opus magnum, I might obtain one of these. To study its... Unique skills.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_91;Such a simple brute... Yet there was nobility in his relentless spirit. I can admire that.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_92;Weak minds crumble when touched by magic. Poor, wretched man. Can't let his wailing influence my judgment.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_93;Your pathethic magic is only fit for scaring children at bedtime. Rest forgotten, witch.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_94;Now THIS is a force of nature. How it drew upon the power of the intersection... Effortless!
adventure_dialogue_alzur_95;Fierce, primeval magic! If only I had a spare lifetime to study it!
adventure_dialogue_alzur_96;Ugh. Progress demands sacrifice, I guess. Apparently sometimes you need to sacrifice your boots. And cloak. And breeches.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_97;With thunder and ice we shall battle, and it will be as the end of the world!
adventure_dialogue_alzur_98;Magnificent creature.
adventure_dialogue_alzur_99;Which arrogant warlock was it that roused you from the deep?

adventure_dialogue_lilly_10;Anything hurt?
adventure_dialogue_lilly_11;I can't imagine anything putting a dent in your pride.
adventure_dialogue_lilly_12;We'll come better prepared.
adventure_dialogue_lilly_13;Back to the drawing board, then.
adventure_dialogue_lilly_14;A school of life indeed.
adventure_dialogue_lilly_15;You mean: human subjects.
adventure_dialogue_lilly_16;You scare me at times.
adventure_dialogue_lilly_17;Calm down, dear. They will see that we are in the right one day. This is why we must remain focused.
adventure_dialogue_lilly_18;Don't be so harsh, love. Maybe she had a rough upbringing.
adventure_dialogue_lilly_19;It is, truly. I'd much rather capture its beauty than take its life.
adventure_dialogue_lilly_2;The sun is out, yet the air feels cold.
adventure_dialogue_lilly_3;A mother looking after her children is hardly a monster, is it?
adventure_dialogue_lilly_4;I know, but... When you chase the dream for so long, it is easy to lose sight of the principles that guided us in the first place.
adventure_dialogue_lilly_5;See how my pendant trembles? Yet, there were no monsters in sight around that stone.
adventure_dialogue_lilly_6;Is it snowing? Huh.
adventure_dialogue_lilly_7;The blizzard will hit us hard at the summit. I hope we are prepared.

adventure_ending_script_1_short_description;The Condemned
adventure_ending_script_1_title;First Experiment
adventure_ending_script_2_contents;During his most recent excursion to the North, Alzur, cursed by an insatiable curiosity, found himself pursuing the mystery behind a series of suspicious deaths.\n\nThanks to the mage’s incredible knack for deductive reasoning, he was able to identify the culprit: a courtesan with a grudge against men, and a penchant for poison. \n\nThe disillusioned woman had most wickedly murdered dozens of clients using a concoction of rare herbs, her chosen toxins leaving each victim writhing in mortal agony as their insides slowly melted away. \n\nEver the opportunist, Alzur offered the woman a choice: she could face the wrath of the townsfolk she’d wronged⁠—a death sentence, for sure⁠—or she could come with the mage, take her chances with his experiment, and perhaps live to see another day…\n\nShe chose the latter. \n\nOf course, the mage had hoped she would survive the procedure, but if her life was to be forfeited, he surmised, then perhaps she could find redemption in her sacrifice. After all, she had caused much suffering with her poisons; it seemed only fitting that she should endure Alzur’s concoctions in an effort to help save countless lives. \n\nYet, this particular experiment yielded results that confounded the mage. The mutations designed to perform the arduous task of reshaping the body simply stood idle⁠—the process behaving more akin to a subtle poisoning. She did not squirm; she did not struggle; she did not suffer in any tangible way. The courtesan simply closed her eyes. \n\nAnd then she died. \n\nThis fruitless attempt with the courtesan had ingrained in the mage a prejudice that he would never shake, and from that day onward, of the many subjects exposed to his experiments, only a handful would be female.
adventure_ending_script_2_short_description;The Baneful Courtesan
adventure_ending_script_2_title;Second Experiment
adventure_ending_script_3_contents;A malignant plague known as the Wheezing Death had swept through a small hamlet in the hills. \n\nArriving in search of new candidates for his research, Alzur discovered the devastation left in the scourge’s wake. Everyone, it seemed, had already perished. Save one…\n\nA young boy, sulking amid the corpses of his kin, was somehow still alive. Albeit, evidently quite sick and deteriorating fast. Without intervention, the boy’s fate was surely sealed, and so Alzur, unsure of what else to do, took the orphan with him. \n\nWhilst the mage’s mutations could provide salvation for the ailing child, Alzur did not wish to subject the boy to a painful end if he didn’t have to. For days, he scoured his mind for a better alternative, but the boy was too far gone and no other method worked. \n\nBy the time Alzur decided to proceed with the experiment, the child was at death’s door. And so, with utmost delicacy, he sedated the boy and used a careful combination of diluted concoctions. \n\nDays of suffering followed, of high fever and vomiting and violent shaking. Yet, to Alzur’s surprise, the boy’s condition finally improved. Better yet, his once-frail body showed visible improvements and physical development beyond what a boy of his age should possess. \n\nIt was a monumental breakthrough. Yet the triumph was short-lived. \n\nDespite his augmentations, the small boy perished days later, the exact cause of his death a mystery. \n\nAlthough crestfallen, the glimpse of success ignited hope within the exhausted mage, and while he did not yet want to admit it, he had in that moment discovered the secret to a favourable mutation: youth.
adventure_ending_script_3_short_description;The Wheezing Child
adventure_ending_script_3_title;Fourth Experiment
adventure_ending_script_4_contents;An acquaintance from years past had heard tales of Alzur’s experiments and decided to track down the mage.\n\nOnce a gallant knight, bursting with vigor and in the prime of his youth, he had, like the few humans lucky enough to live so long, become old and frail.\n\nDesperately wanting to recapture his long-lost strength, he proffered his body for experimentation. A quick death in pursuit of his wish was better than a slow, pathetic crawl towards the grave, he declared.\n\nBut Alzur would not have it. He knew full well that the knight’s weak frame would not survive the procedure and did not want to expose a friend to unnecessary suffering. As it was, because of the man’s advanced age, the experiment was unlikely to yield beneficial results.\n\nYet, the man was insistent. And during their squabble, a thought struck Alzur. Something he had somehow not yet contemplated. Instead of injecting his concoctions, why not have the subject ingest a milder blend beforehand? To better prime the body for future, more invasive, mutations…\n\nAnd so the mage brewed a diluted mixture of the required herbs into a tea and gave it to the man, curious of its effect.\n\nFor days, the old knight’s health declined as he drifted between states of lucidity and delirium.\n\nBut then he recovered.\n\nEuphoric with delight, the old man claimed to feel more vigorous than he’d done in decades. But the feeling was not enough to sate his desires.\n\nOnce he had tasted the intoxicating nectar of vitality, he lusted for more, demanding that Alzur submit him to the entire procedure, no matter the risk.\n\nAfter much debate, Alzur finally agreed. \n\nUnfortunately, the experiment ended precisely as he’d predicted.

challenge_faction_1_leader_1_desc;Radovid the Stern, Fifth of His Name, King of Redania, was a polarizing figure. Some considered him a brilliant strategist, a superb general. Others – a bloodthirsty, paranoid madman. The truth lay, as the truth is wont to do, somewhere in the middle.
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_match_1;Steel Skin
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_match_1_desc;Radovid liked to say a soldier is only as strong as his breastplate. In the end, even the best swordsman cannot change the tides of battle if he falls to one stray arrow or a single lucky blow. That’s why Radovid never begrudged his infantry quartermasters the coin to buy solid armor.
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_match_1_strategy;Harald deals a lot of damage - boost your units so they don't get destroyed.
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_match_1_strategy_2;Radovid can help you take out Clan Axemen.
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_match_2;Strength in Numbers
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_match_2_desc;Human soldiers are neither as strong as dwarves nor as dexterous as elves. Yet they have one clear advantage over both elder races: their numbers. Gather a mass of humans, put swords in their hands and a half-decent commander in front… and there is no force that could hope to stop them.
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_match_2_strategy;Watch out for Francesca - she can draw any card she wants at any time.
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_match_2_strategy_2;Use Radovid to deal with resilient units like Mahakam Defenders.
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_match_3;Galloping Death
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_match_3_desc;Radovid is known for stating there is no problem a gallant charge of heavy cavalry cannot solve. Some doubt the truth of this declaration. Some clearly have not seen Redanian riders in action.
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_match_3_strategy;Dagon can spawn a Hazard at any time, so make sure you've got First Light.
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_match_3_strategy_2;Radovid can shut down Ancient Foglets and Barbegazis.
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_title;Radovid
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_desc;King Henselt stumbled ungainly on the dance floor and tripped over his tongue at courtly salons. On the battlefield, however, he moved as deftly as a fish in water. He knew all his infantrymen by name and could recite the range of each and every catapult to the inch.
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_match_1;Wooden Army
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_match_1_desc;Henselt adored his war machines. He would walk the ranks of his catapults like a proud father, tenderly stroking each ballista and trebuchet. He kept dozens and dozens of these contraptions in reserve – and built more any chance he got.
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_match_1_strategy;Watch out for Calveit - he can grab an extra card from his deck at any time.
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_match_1_strategy_2;Henselt can pull all copies of certain allies in your deck onto the board - use him to quickly gain a decisive lead.
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_match_2;Shoulder to Shoulder
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_match_2_desc;Henselt would often say two heads are better than one, and three – even better still. Thus he’d always order his troops to march into battle in threes, trios of soldiers fighting shoulder to shoulder. His generals were skeptical of this strategy… But changed their minds when they saw the results.
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_match_2_strategy;Bran can quickly fill his graveyard with units - watch out, because many Skellige abilities interact with the dead.
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_match_2_strategy_2;Henselt can pull all copies of certain allies in your deck onto the board - use him to quickly gain a decisive lead.
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_match_3;Blue Stripes
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_match_3_desc;When King Foltest answered Henselt’s request for aid with twenty foot soldiers in striped uniforms, Henselt grew furious. What difference could they possibly make...? Well. As it turned out, an enormous one.
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_match_3_strategy;Watch out for Radovid - he'll try to take out any of your units that have powerful passive abilities.
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_match_3_strategy_2;Henselt can pull all copies of certain allies in your deck onto the board - use him to quickly gain a decisive lead.
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_title;Henselt
challenge_faction_2;Skellige
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_desc;As a warrior, Harald was thoroughly unremarkable. Then a bear mangled his leg and the bone healed back crooked. After that, each step caused him agonizing pain… and he fought better than ever before. He claimed the grit of constant suffering had honed an unstoppable edge.
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_match_1;Practiced in Pain
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_match_1_desc;Harald lived his entire life in excruciating pain, making him somewhat of an expert on the subject. This expertise extending to inflicting pain in others as well, to knowing where to strike to cause the greatest possible suffering, to evoke the most gut-wrenching screams. Soon, his foes would throw down their arms as soon as they heard his name.
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_match_1_strategy;Voorhis can reveal cards in your hand, gaining valuable information. Plus, many of his units benefit for every card revealed.
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_match_1_strategy_2;Harald can deal a lot of damage to your enemies - combine this with your units' abilities to defeat your opponent.
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_match_2;Battle Fury
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_match_2_desc;Cadets at Nilfgaard’s officer academy are drilled in the following rule: only strike a Skelliger if you’re confident your blow will kill. If you merely wound… you will quickly regret it.
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_match_2_strategy;Eithne and her units focus on using special cards. Destroy her units to stop this strategy in its tracks.
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_match_2_strategy_2;Harald can deal a lot of damage to your enemies - combine this with your units' abilities to defeat your opponent.
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_match_3;Bloodlust
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_match_3_desc;The backbone of Harald’s army consisted of axemen from Clan Tuirseach. These warriors thrived off bloodshed, growing faster, stronger and more resilient with every foe they slew. Harald’s opponents knew they needed either incapacitate the axemen at the start of the battle – or die by their hands.
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_match_3_strategy;The Unseen Elder and his minions will try to steal your units' power. Boost your troops evenly to avoid giving them juicy targets.
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_match_3_strategy_2;Harald can deal a lot of damage to your enemies - combine this with your units' abilities to defeat your opponent.
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_title;Harald the Cripple
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_desc;They say the seas smashing against Skellige’s shores would sooner bow to a ruler than its inhabitants. Yet they bowed to Bran. He united all the clans in the isles behind him, and held them together in an iron fist until his death.
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_match_1;Iron Fleet
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_match_1_desc;When an army loses men, it should grow weaker. It is a simple dictate of logic. Yet Skellige routinely defies dictates, logic’s included. In fact, the fewer warriors Bran has in his charge, the more fiercely they fight. Thus when foes watch his ranks thin and their hearts begin rise… a Skellige axe cleaves them through moments later.
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_match_1_strategy;Brouver and his dwarves focus on boosting and Strengthening each other. Destroy his units to shut this strategy down.
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_match_1_strategy_2;Use Bran to send cards to the graveyard, then Resurrect them when the time is ripe.
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_match_2;Honor Guard
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_match_2_desc;To say Bran’s personal guard was loyal is like saying winter in the isles tends to be rather chilly, or its seas grow a bit choppy during storms. The Skellige maidens who served as his protectors defended their king fiercely, fighting through any injury short of death itself…and sometimes, through that as well.
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_match_2_strategy;The Arachas Queen tries to amass a mighty army. Try to disrupt this strategy or focus on building up your own strength.
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_match_2_strategy_2;Use Bran to send cards to the graveyard, then Resurrect them when the time is ripe.
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_match_3;Immortal Islanders
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_match_3_desc;King Bran’s enemies would swear they crossed swords with warriors they had killed personally during earlier battles - not just once, but two times or more. Most think this foolish superstition, the wild tales of scarred soldiers, nothing more… But those who know Skellige well give such stories much credence. In the isles, death is not permanent.
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_match_3_strategy;Watch out for Henselt - he can bring many units onto the board in one move.
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_match_3_strategy_2;Use Bran to send cards to the graveyard, then Resurrect them when the time is ripe.
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_title;Bran
challenge_faction_3;Monsters
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_desc;Anyone who's encountered an arachas knows how incredibly lethal these creatures are. Yet few realize the most vicious among them are their females - especially their queen.
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_match_1;Tyrant of the Wild
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_match_1_desc;The queens of arachas swarms are larger and more powerful than their drones. They dominate and command not only their weaker kin, but also other creatures living near their nest. Woe to any who intrude on their territory.
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_match_1_strategy;Watch out for Calveit - he can grab an extra card from his deck at any time.
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_match_1_strategy_2;The Arachas Queen is immune to most abilities, but can still be destroyed by Scorch. Be careful not to boost her too much.
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_match_2;Natural Selection
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_match_2_desc;Arachas queens show no motherly love for their offspring. True, they defend their young, but when no other sustenance can be found, they will devour their own children without hesitation. In such cases, only those strong enough to flee the nest early survive.
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_match_2_strategy;Harald deals a lot of damage - boost your units so they don't get destroyed.
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_match_2_strategy_2;The Arachas Queen is immune to most abilities, but can still be destroyed by Scorch. Be careful not to boost her too much.
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_match_3;Survival Instinct
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_match_3_desc;When her nest is threatened, an enraged arachas queen becomes a terrifying foe. Not only is she faster and stronger than her lesser kin, she also calls upon the help of all those who can hear her cry.
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_match_3_strategy;Foltest will focus on building a strong army. Try to disrupt his strategy or concentrate on bolstering your own forces.
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_match_3_strategy_2;The Arachas Queen is immune to most abilities, but can still be destroyed by Scorch. Be careful not to boost her too much.
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_title;Arachas Queen
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_desc;King of the Wild Hunt and usurper of the throne of Tir ná Lia. He assassinated the previous king of the Aen Elle, convinced the old ruler was not equipped to face the threat of the White Frost. Eredin is ruthless and will do anything to save his folk.
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_match_1;Blood of Elves
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_match_1_desc;The king of the Wild Hunt does not hold his elven cousins, the Aen Seidhe, in high respect. In his eyes, they are weaklings who let "lower" races dominate their world. Thus when the need arises, Eredin does not think twice about spilling elven blood.
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_match_1_strategy;Watch out for Francesca - she can draw any card she wants at any time.
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_match_1_strategy_2;Eredin can spawn powerful allies - use him at the right time to gain the advantage.
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_match_2;Slave Hunters
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_match_2_desc;Skellige is one of Eredin's favorite hunting grounds for new slaves. The isles' warriors are fierce and hearty, perfect for physical labor on Tir ná Lia. But that is not the only reason. The King of the Hunt draws sadistic pleasure from breaking these proud men and women.
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_match_2_strategy;Crach's warriors can grow to be very powerful if you let them. Try to knock them off the board as soon as you can.
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_match_2_strategy_2;Eredin can spawn powerful allies - use him at the right time to gain the advantage.
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_match_3;Horseman of the Apocalypse
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_match_3_desc;Wherever Eredin roams, he brings frost and death with him. The King of the Hunt is not only an expert swordsman, but also a master of magic arcana. Whenever he needs, he can summon more warriors from Tir ná Lia. No wonder, then, the appearance of the Wild Hunt arouses wails of terror.
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_match_3_strategy;The Arachas Queen tries to amass a mighty army. Try to disrupt this strategy or focus on building up your own strength.
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_match_3_strategy_2;Eredin can spawn powerful allies - use him at the right time to gain the advantage.
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_title;Eredin
challenge_faction_4;Scoia'tael
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_desc;Even mortal enemies sometimes find common cause and make fragile pacts. Yet not Eithné, no. The queen of the dryads’ hatred for humans is absolute, brooking no exceptions. No matter how they plead, beg or threaten, she always gives them the same answer - an arrow to the head.
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_match_1;Defenders of Brokilon
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_match_1_desc;Brokilon is no common wood. This ancient entanglement of trees hums with magic, a primal energy pulsing from its soft breezes and burbling brooks. The dryads have learned draw on this, taking from it strength far beyond that of any man or elf.
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_match_1_strategy;Emhyr can replay one of his allies, triggering its ability again. Destroy them before he gets a chance.
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_match_1_strategy_2;Eithne lets you play a special card from your graveyard - use her to play Reconnaissance and build up your army.
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_match_2;The Elder Race Alliance
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_match_2_desc;Dryads are distrustful by nature and avoid all outsiders. They only make exceptions for elves, with whom they will join forces when outnumbered. In such cases, the enemy’s numerical superiority quickly counts for very little. All those not cut down by elven blades succumb to powerful dryadic spells.
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_match_2_strategy;Eredin and his allies can spawn Frost, so keep First Light at the ready.
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_match_2_strategy_2;Eithne lets you play a special card from the graveyard - use her to get rid of Frost whenever Eredin spawns it.
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_match_3;The Waters of Brokilon
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_match_3_desc;The waters of Brokilon are famed for their extraordinary properties. People who drink of them lose their memory and dryads are said to see visions of the future in their smooth surfaces. No wonder, then, that their armies seem prepared for every eventuality…
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_match_3_strategy;Watch out for Henselt - he can bring many units onto the board in one move.
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_match_3_strategy_2;Eithne lets you play a special card from your graveyard - use her to play Reconnaissance and build up your army.
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_title;Eithné
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_desc;Francesca Findabair, known as the Daisy of the Valley, is widely considered the most beautiful woman in the world. Her physical charms are matched only by her enormous magic talent and keen political instincts.
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_match_1;Queen of Elves
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_match_1_desc;The Free Elves of Dol Blathanna owe Francesca everything they have - thus it comes as no surprise they are willing to die with her name on their lips. Yet the Scoia'tael do not respect her with similar ardor. They begrudge her all the elven blood she spilt for, in their eyes, a futile cause.
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_match_1_strategy;Bran can quickly fill his graveyard with units - watch out, because many Skellige abilities interact with the dead.
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_match_1_strategy_2;Francesca lets you draw a new card at any time - use this to gain the advantage.
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_match_2;Visionary
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_match_2_desc;During the Second Northern War, she signed a pact with the Nilfgaardian Empire that let the Free Elves rebuild a realm of their own in Dol Blathanna. Yet when the war ended, fighting broke out between the Empire and Scoia'tael warriors…
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_match_2_strategy;Voorhis can reveal cards in your hand, gaining valuable information. Plus, many of his units benefit for every card revealed.
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_match_2_strategy_2;Francesca lets you draw a new card at any time - use this to gain the advantage.
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_match_3;Archmistress
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_match_3_desc;Before the war Francesca was a member of the Conclave of Mages and later joined the mysterious Lodge of Sorceresses. Her great magic talent earned her respect and awe from her colleagues, though no one truly knows the full extent of her abilities.
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_match_3_strategy;Dagon can spawn a Hazard at any time, so make sure you've got First Light.
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_match_3_strategy_2;Francesca lets you draw a new card at any time - use this to gain the advantage.
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_title;Francesca
challenge_faction_5;Nilfgaard
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_desc;Emhyr var Emreis, the White Flame Dancing on the Graves of his Foes, well deserves his nickname. Ever since he tore the imperial diadem out of the Usurper's hands, he dedicated all the power at his disposal to eliminating his political enemies.
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_match_1;Worthy Rival
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_match_1_desc;After eliminating most of the kings of the Northern Realms, Emhyr thought Nilfgaard's victory in the Third Northern War would be swift and complete. To his surprise, he found himself facing a worthy foe in the form of King Radovid the Fifth.
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_match_1_strategy;Watch out for Radovid - he'll try to take out any of your units that have powerful passive abilities.
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_match_1_strategy_2;Emhyr lets you replay one of your allies, triggering its ability again. Try to use him on a powerful unit before your opponent destroys it.
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_match_2;Countless Armies
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_match_2_desc;Emhyr always considered the witcher caste a relict of a bygone era. The mutants made superb killers, true, but he preferred to eliminate monsters using other, cheaper methods.
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_match_2_strategy;Eredin and his allies can spawn Frost, so keep First Light at the ready.
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_match_2_strategy_2;Emhyr lets you replay one of your allies, triggering its ability again. Try to use him on a powerful unit before your opponent destroys it.
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_match_3;Cast-Off Tools
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_match_3_desc;The Scoia'tael were one of the tools Emhyr wielded during the Second Northern War. Their purpose: to spread chaos behind enemy lines. With the war's end, their usefulness expired and their questionable methods became a bone of contention during diplomatic talks with the kings of the North.
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_match_3_strategy;Eithne and her units focus on using special cards. Destroy her units to stop this strategy in its tracks.
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_match_3_strategy_2;Emhyr lets you replay one of your allies, triggering its ability again. Try to use him on a powerful unit before your opponent destroys it.
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_title;Emhyr
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_desc;Morvran Voorhis was fond of saying he could win a war without a single sword. There was much truth in that: Voorhis’ strategy revolved around the shrewd use of spies and saboteurs. This might not have earned him much honor – but it did earn him a great many victories..
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_match_1;Diplomatic Arts
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_match_1_desc;Morvran Voorhis liked to keep close tabs on his enemy’s activities. To this end, he would write them numerous lengthy letters. The contents were pure drivel, flowery formulations saying exactly nothing, but the emissaries he sent to deliver them kept their eyes wide open…
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_match_1_strategy;Crach's warriors can grow to be very powerful if you let them. Try to knock them off the board as soon as you can.
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_match_1_strategy_2;Voorhis lets you reveal cards in your opponent's hand - use him to predict their moves. Remember you can also reveal your own cards to trigger your units' abilities.
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_match_2;Questionable Loyalty
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_match_2_desc;Morvran Voorhis cultivated both a wide-ranging network of skilled spies working on the empire’s behalf… and special Nauzicaa Brigade officers devoted to dealing with agents foolish enough to betray it.
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_match_2_strategy;Brouver and his dwarves focus on boosting and Strengthening each other. Destroy his units to shut this strategy down.
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_match_2_strategy_2;Voorhis lets you reveal cards in your opponent's hand - use him to predict their moves. Remember you can also reveal your own cards to trigger your units' abilities.
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_match_3;Double Agents
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_match_3_desc;Voorhis recognized no rules in warfare. To vanquish, he was willing to make common cause with anyone, be they renegades from witcher schools, war criminals or rebellious mages. Only one thing mattered: victory.
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_match_3_strategy;The Unseen Elder and his minions will try to steal your units' power. Boost your troops evenly to avoid giving them juicy targets.

cs.adventure_cutscene_ftux.1;Alzur and Lilly, eager to see years of research come to fruition, had finally been spurred to action...
cs.adventure_cutscene_ftux.10;...But, try as he might, kill it… he could not. With violent urges sated, the Failed Experiment fled from the laboratory... 
cs.adventure_cutscene_ftux.11;...leaving Alzur alone to wallow in the wake of his failure... 
cs.adventure_cutscene_ftux.12;...which was absolute. Darkness and despair consumed the mage...
cs.adventure_cutscene_ftux.13;...for days, weeks, months.
cs.adventure_cutscene_ftux.14;Until, eventually, sorrow paved the way to a solitary purpose.
cs.adventure_cutscene_ftux.15;Alzur would now ensure, above all else, that his beloved Lilly had not died in vain.
cs.adventure_cutscene_ftux.2;...by a chance encounter.
cs.adventure_cutscene_ftux.3;In a nearby village, a brute of a man had been sentenced to death. Yet he did not find his fate at the end of the hangman’s rope.
cs.adventure_cutscene_ftux.4;Instead, the mages purchased his life, for he was the perfect vessel for their experiment.
cs.adventure_cutscene_ftux.5;Sure of their science, they promptly began, sedating the man and flooding his veins with myriad concoctions. As expected, the subject mutated... 
cs.adventure_cutscene_ftux.6;...but most violently so.
cs.adventure_cutscene_ftux.7;His body, twisted by the tinctures, warped into a foul abomination. With new-found strength...
cs.adventure_cutscene_ftux.8;...the monstrosity broke free from its bonds. Bewildered and bitter, it lashed out in frenzied rage.
cs.adventure_cutscene_ftux.9;Jagged claws pierced Lilly, rending flesh from bone.\nAlzur fought the monster back...
cs.adventure_cutscene_intro.1;Long ago, the Continent was draped in darkness.
cs.adventure_cutscene_intro.10;And so they turned to science.
cs.adventure_cutscene_intro.11;Envisioning a way to use mutation to their advantage.
cs.adventure_cutscene_intro.12;To create exceptional beings without fear or weakness.
cs.adventure_cutscene_intro.13;Their bodies imbued with the very essence of the beasts they would vanquish.
cs.adventure_cutscene_intro.14;Yet, for this... 
cs.adventure_cutscene_intro.15;Alzur and Lylianna needed to deepen their understanding of mutagens.
cs.adventure_cutscene_intro.16;And turn theory into practice⁠—no matter the terrible cost.
cs.adventure_cutscene_intro.2;Its lands overrun by otherworldly monsters⁠—rabid beasts most foul.
cs.adventure_cutscene_intro.3;A scourge, and a plague. Sowing destruction and reaping despair.
cs.adventure_cutscene_intro.4;Those who wished to end the plight took up arms against the wretched creatures.
cs.adventure_cutscene_intro.5;All of them brave. All noble.
cs.adventure_cutscene_intro.6;All… doomed.
cs.adventure_cutscene_intro.7;Yet, amid the anguish, there was still hope.
cs.adventure_cutscene_intro.8;Alzur and Lylianna⁠—mages committed to ridding the world of all its horrors.
cs.adventure_cutscene_intro.9;They knew magic alone could not solve the problem⁠—those wielding it were too few, the infestation too vast.
cs.adventure_cutscene_master.1;Alzur had made many sacrifices in his pursuit, and the toll now weighed heavily upon his soul.
cs.adventure_cutscene_master.10;There would be no more half measures. Youth⁠, he concluded, it had to be.
cs.adventure_cutscene_master.11;With his new process all but perfected, Alzur sedated the young boy he had adopted during his latest excursion, then carefully administered his concoctions.
cs.adventure_cutscene_master.12;In spite of all the odds, the procedure did not mangle the boy’s body. Nor did it render him inert. By all means... 
cs.adventure_cutscene_master.13;The experiment was a resounding success.
cs.adventure_cutscene_master.14;After decades dedicated to a singular purpose -- after strife, struggle, and sacrifice -- Alzur had finally accomplished his task. He had engineered a mold in 
cs.adventure_cutscene_master.15;which he could shape the perfect slayer of beasts.
cs.adventure_cutscene_master.16;He had formed the catalyst that would mark the beginning of the end for the age of monsters.
cs.adventure_cutscene_master.17;He had, through science and sorcery, given birth to... a ‘witcher’. 
cs.adventure_cutscene_master.18;That was Alzur's story. The children he transformed would tell a different one. But no one gave them a voice.
cs.adventure_cutscene_master.19;But at what price?
cs.adventure_cutscene_master.2;Yet, failure now would erase all past gains.
cs.adventure_cutscene_master.3;And losses.
cs.adventure_cutscene_master.4;He had spent so many years of his life scouring the lands,
cs.adventure_cutscene_master.5;Slaying abominable monstrosities,
cs.adventure_cutscene_master.6;And gathering vital resources,
cs.adventure_cutscene_master.7;All in steadfast loyalty to the promise he had once made.
cs.adventure_cutscene_master.8;Alzur needed only to take the final step.
cs.adventure_cutscene_master.9;For too long he had hoped there would be another way. Alas, he could ignore the obvious no longer...

faction_monsters_0_desc_name;White Frost
faction_monsters_0_desc_text;<color=#ef7070><link=20005501>White Frost</link></color> allows you to move an opponent’s unit to the other row and apply <color=#ef7070><link=frost>Frost</link></color>, which will then damage the highest-power unit on that row by 2 for the next 2 turns. This can be particularly useful as a counter to enemy cards with abilities tied to a specific row.
faction_monsters_1_desc_name;Dominance
faction_monsters_1_desc_text;Cards with <color=#ef7070><link=dominance>Dominance</link></color>, such as <color=#ef7070><link=13240200>Wild Hunt Hound</link></color>, unlock their full potential when you control the highest-power unit on the battlefield. This highest-power unit can also be the card played, allowing you to play <color=#ef7070><link=13231000>Wild Hunt Rider</link></color> on an empty board and benefit from its <color=#ef7070><link=dominance>Dominance</link></color>.
faction_monsters_2_desc_name;Frost
faction_monsters_2_desc_text;Applying <color=#ef7070><link=frost>Frost</link></color> with a card such as <color=#ef7070><link=20261200>Naglfar’s Crew</link></color>⁠ to a row that already has <color=#ef7070><link=frost>Frost</link></color> will increase the current effect’s duration. Remember to choose which row to apply <color=#ef7070><link=frost>Frost</link></color> to carefully as it can be critical to maintaining <color=#ef7070><link=dominance>Dominance</link></color> for your other cards.

faction_nilfgaard_0_desc_name;Double Cross
faction_nilfgaard_0_desc_text;<color=#ef7070><link=20218601>Double Cross</link></color> allows you to take a peek at 3 of the cards in your opponent’s hand and choose one to copy and then play. This can be particularly effective when your opponent has only 3 cards left, as it will tell you exactly what tools your opponent has left to use against you.
faction_nilfgaard_1_desc_name;Assimilate
faction_nilfgaard_1_desc_text;Cards with <color=#ef7070><link=assimilate>Assimilate</link></color> will receive a boost each time you play a card that wasn’t in your starting deck. <color=#ef7070><link=20223900>Artorius Vigo</link></color>, for example, will create a copy of one of the bronze cards in your starting deck and will boost himself and all other <color=#ef7070><link=assimilate>Assimilate</link></color> cards you control by 1 (unless specified differently) after doing so.
faction_nilfgaard_2_desc_name;Disloyal
faction_nilfgaard_2_desc_text;Cards like <color=#ef7070><link=20224800>Duchess’s Informant</link></color> are <color=#ef7070><link=disloyal>Disloyal</link></color>, meaning you must play them on your opponent’s side of the board. These cards will also gain a <color=#ef7070><link=spying>Spying</link></color> status once played. <color=#ef7070><link=20224800>Duchess’s Informant</link></color> creates a copy of a bronze enemy card for you to play on your side, and is useful for stealing your opponent’s strategy.

faction_northernrealms_0_desc_name;Uprising
faction_northernrealms_0_desc_text;<color=#ef7070><link=20257401>Uprising</link></color> lets you boost a unit 3 times, allowing you to protect valuable cards. For maximum efficiency, save your charges until you’re ready to deploy the <color=#ef7070><link=20216100>Lyrian Scytheman</link></color>, which will be created once you’ve used up all charges. Deploy this card to a row filled with boosted units to perform a powerful finishing play.
faction_northernrealms_1_desc_name;Inspired
faction_northernrealms_1_desc_text;Cards like <color=#ef7070><link=20215200>Anna Strenger</link></color> have stronger abilities when <color=#ef7070><link=inspired>Inspired</link></color>, meaning when they are boosted above their base power, their impact on the battlefield grows. It’s usually wise to prioritize boosting such units to gain the upper hand.
faction_northernrealms_2_desc_name;Formation
faction_northernrealms_2_desc_text;Cards with <color=#ef7070><link=order>Orders</link></color> can not normally execute their ability until the turn after they are played. However, those with the <color=#ef7070><link=formation>Formation</link></color> keyword⁠ ⁠— like <color=#ef7070><link=20242100>Radovid’s Royal Guards</link></color> ⁠— have the option to do so. Play these cards on the melee row to use their order ability immediately, OR play them on the ranged row to gain one point of boost.
faction_northernrealms_description;Unite your forces and bolster them to overpower any foe.
faction_scoiatael_0_desc_name;Nature’s Gift
faction_scoiatael_0_desc_text;<color=#ef7070><link=20016501>Nature’s Gift</link></color> can be used 3 times to give a unit <color=#ef7070><link=vitality>Vitality</link></color> ⁠— a status that boosts them by 1 at the end of your current and next turn. It can be especially effective on <color=#ef7070><link=20267800>Hamadryads</link></color> and can be applied multiple times to the same unit to extend its duration.
faction_scoiatael_1_desc_name;Symbiosis
faction_scoiatael_1_desc_text;Thanks to the <color=#ef7070><link=symbiosis>Symbiosis</link></color> ability of <color=#ef7070><link=20016500>Nature’s Gift</link></color>, whenever you play a special card with the <color=#ef7070><link=nature>Nature</link></color> category ⁠— like <color=#ef7070><link=20226900>Dryad’s Caress</link></color> ⁠— you will spawn a 1-power Treant on the board. The power of the <color=#ef7070><link=20268300>Treants</link></color> you create increases by 1 for every unit with <color=#ef7070><link=symbiosis>Symbiosis</link></color> you currently control.
faction_scoiatael_2_desc_name;Hand boosting
faction_scoiatael_2_desc_text;Play cards like  <color=#ef7070><link=20267700>Circle of Life</link></color> early in a round to boost a random Scoia’tael unit in your hand before you play it. With this special card, if you manage to kill the unit you damage, the <color=#ef7070><link=deathblow>Deathblow</link></color> effect will allow you to choose which unit gets boosted.

faction_skellige_0_desc_name;Patricidal Fury
faction_skellige_0_desc_text;Use <color=#ef7070><link=20211901>Patricidal Fury</link></color> to unleash <color=#ef7070><link=20218200>Arnjolf the Patricide</link></color>. This not only grants you an 11-point body but also results in 3 damaged sirens on the enemy side, allowing you to gain even more power from cards like <color=#ef7070><link=15210600>Madman Lugos</link></color>. It can also be used to fill up your opponent’s row, preventing them from playing more cards on it.
faction_skellige_1_desc_name;Veteran
faction_skellige_1_desc_text;Skellige warriors only get stronger as the battle drags on. Each round, cards with <color=#ef7070><link=veteran>Veteran</link></color> gain 1 base power, making cards like <color=#ef7070><link=20262300>Tuirseach Invader</link></color> that much better in later rounds.
faction_skellige_2_desc_name;Bloodthirst
faction_skellige_2_desc_text;<color=#ef7070><link=20262400>An Craite Raiders</link></color> let you deal 2 damage to a unit of your choice on the turn after it’s played. Its <color=#ef7070><link=bloodthirst>Bloodthirst</link></color> condition allows you to deal this damage immediately after playing it via the <color=#ef7070><link=zeal>Zeal</link></color> ability, but only if your opponent has at least 3 damaged units.

journey_1_story_extended_1_new;Geralt was fighting.\nThe potions he had drunk were still lingering in his veins, sharpening his senses. Last night the damp air clung to his lungs. His heavy breathing marking the rhythm of his strikes.\nThe witcher cursed vehemently as he struggled to strike the creature’s scale-covered flesh. Having finally hit the mark, the wounded creature retreated; diving swiftly underwater; somehow vanishing despite its large size. So he cursed once more whilst panting heavily, until finally taking a hesitant step forward. Then another despite the thick sludge clinging aggressively to his legs. Something slithery crawled into his boot, sending chills deep into his bones.\nHe barely managed to turn around as black water gushed out behind his back.\nThe giant vypper, surely as old as the surrounding swamp, had been hunting around Gulet for years. For years it had been killing, growing in size and hardening it’s now rigid scales. Until the local mayor decided to pay a witcher to end its rampage…\nNot enough, Geralt thought, evading a stream of toxic venom.\nDefinitely not enough.
journey_1_story_extended_10;Funeral.\nThere shall be a funeral, Geralt was convinced of it, especially considering the joyful news he had heard from the market. Someone had already spread rumors of a misalliance between a certain young miss named Kora and a Viscount of Lettenhove...\nWas it the same lady who, as if by chance, came across them in the middle of the night? Yelling at Dandelion for the disgrace she had suffered? The bard, of course, quickly resorted to sweet lies, promising that he would repay her for any harm done. When she refused to calm down, he flaunted a noble title, which was likely yet another lie. Nonetheless, young Kora immediately cheered up, promptly ending her accusations and threats to not only call upon her brothers but the city guards as well. A poor threat, but they were particularly drunk and dim-witted at the time. So Dandelion went with her, leaving the witcher his lute for safekeeping and assuring him that he would return once the maiden had fallen asleep. Now Geralt had a strong inkling that it was Kora who had slipped out of bed to chat with peddlers, and gods only know with who else. Her family was likely already adjusting plans of the previously planned celebration, unaware that an impoverished artist was replacing a wealthy merchant. Geralt felt confident that the truth regarding the groom would inevitably be revealed. Her brothers will heat tar, and the would-be spouse will meet the executioner.\nJust a quick funeral.
journey_1_story_extended_11;Geralt hoped that the funeral would not take place if he helped the bard escape. The witcher did not hold the slightest doubt concerning the eventuality of Dandelion's escape attempt from his upcoming nuptials. So he went to the mayor's house, where he hoped to find the equally hungover poet along with his blushing bride to be. At the gates of the estate, however, he saw familiar faces: a real wedding party led by the mayor himself. It seemed that the young bride had even appeased her brothers. Geralt preferred not to guess what she had promised them - preferring to remain as detached as possible. One evening of drunken bonding did not oblige him to rescue the poet, the witcher reminded himself. Declarations made in such a state were not binding, he repeated while making a first step back towards the stables. But then Geralt remembered the lute hidden within his saddlebags. Sighing heavily, he turned back.\nThe witcher wasn't going to risk arrest by starting a fight to free Dandelion, but surely there was no harm in waiting around for some opportunity to aid him, was there?\nUnfortunately, both the bride and her brothers did not leave Dandelion even for a moment. Meanwhile, the mayor played the role of a gracious host, showing his guests around the festival and explaining local rituals, utterly unaware of the tense situation.\nGeralt followed them at a distance, eavesdropping until it became clear when the bard would make his move.
journey_1_story_extended_12;Geralt did not dance.\nAt least he avoided it as much as possible, since navigating the rabble before him required either timely jumps or forceful shoving. The witcher again was looking for Dandelion, who was swallowed by the crowd as soon as the the idiotic tradition began. Instead he spotted a wealthy yet old looking merchant seeming at a loss regarding the actions of his distant fiance. Devils only knew if she ever told the poor fool of her new intentions.\nGeralt pushed forward. Some of the dancing townsfolk tried to stop him, although without much effect. The music bellowed ever louder, making any conversation impossible. Despite this madness, the witcher finally managed to find within the crowd a distinct hat decorated with the feather of a heron. Its owner, to no surprise of the witcher, was obscured by four familiar looking thugs.\nNot wishing to waste a moment longer, Geralt shoved the first of the brothers with all his weight deep into the crowd, away from Dandelion. He then smashed the second one, sending him to the ground, where he fell right under the poet’s feet. He found himself holding the wrist of the third one while the bard performed some idiotic and pointless pirouettes. The witcher ended this spectacle by kicking the ruffian's legs out, sending him hurling onto his back. The fourth took seemingly forever to deal with, mainly due to Dandelion. The poet acted like a jester, trying to mislead his opponent before finally fleeing away. The thug, one moment intent on taking the chase, suddenly turned towards the sound of now screaming Kora. Her original suitor had embraced the poor girl possessively with misery marking her lovely face as she scanned the crowd for one poetic savior. Who, of course, was nowhere to be seen at this point. Meanwhile the witcher, having had his fill of getting involved in the affairs of others, turned and made his way back to the stables.\nHe smiled to himself as he entered to the sight of the bard on the ground. Dandelion was kneeling dramatically, clearly unaware that if he glanced to the left, he would have seen his lute sticking out of Roach's saddlebags. So Geralt smiled, took out the music instrument and told the clumsy fool to compose himself, ending this miserable show.\nSome time later, once on his saddle and well underway to the gates leaving Gulet, he glanced back at the bard who now followed him. It seemed like Dandelion meant to journey with the witcher,\neven to the edge of the world.
journey_1_story_extended_2;Ignore
journey_1_story_extended_2_new;The mayor flinched in disgust at the sight of the monstrous trophy. Still, he peeked curiously into the gaping jaw and tried to count the vypper's teeth. He gave up after thirty-something, casting a meaningful glance at Geralt.\nThe witcher shrugged. Officials such as the mayor often searched for excuses to skimp on payment. It was, however, hard to argue results after having had a vypper’s head slung directly onto your desk.\nThus the mayor of Gulet paid without any hesitation.\nIn fact, he even showed some unusual hospitality towards the witcher, painting a tempting picture of the local spring festival. The streets would flow with boundless alcohol and succulent meats within arms reach. Furthermore, the performance of a talented young poet was planned. So the mayor insisted; “Relax, enjoy our culture at its finest”.\nGeralt took a long look at the bloodied head, which had already begun filling the office with a repugnant stench.\nHe shrugged once more.
journey_1_story_extended_3;Ignore
journey_1_story_extended_3_new;After reaching the market square, Geralt did not immediately search for the stage. First, in order to ensure his merriment, he secured himself the necessities: a bottle of vodka and a ring of sausage. The stocky tradeswoman, who was selling the goods, did not bother to give him a second look.\nClearly an exception.\nWhispers from the growing crowd started and people stepped promptly out of his way. Some glanced failing to hide their fear, others gawked openly at the white-haired witcher. Geralt ignored all of them, calmly sipping vodka and eating the greasy sausage.\nThe sounds of lute began diverting the crowd’s attention.\nMusic flowed from the direction of the nearby town hall and whoever was playing it, was clearly hungover, as both his steps and his melody were clearly not very rhythmical. However, once he began singing, his voice proved to be quite pleasant, and the song itself, entitled “The Ballad of The Two Tiny Tits”, while crude, was quite amusing. Nonetheless, with the performance concluded, Geralt judged the gastronomical feast as superior to the artistic one.\nThe sting of the last gulp of vodka brought tears to his eyes.
journey_1_story_extended_4;Ignore
journey_1_story_extended_4_new;One had to admit that music soothes the savage beast. Those who had previously given Geralt hostile glares now joined in his merriment by drinking vodka and consuming sausages. This, coupled with lively music and dancing raised all their spirits – ergo, he must be a good guy.\nNonetheless, Geralt did not partake in most of the festivities, but he stayed there, to watch the carefree, twirling inhabitants of Gulet. He felt bliss. The kind of bliss that he had not felt for far too long.\nSuddenly he heard a scream. And all his bliss went straight back to hell.\nThe witcher’s senses pinpointed the scuffle as occurring under the stage. He rushed in with a sword in hand, only to quickly sheath it at the sight before him. The assailants were unarmed. They grabbed their terrified victim – the young bard from earlier who seemed to have finally recovered from the previous night. They shook him violently with their bare hands preparing to strike. Behind them, a young half-naked wench was screaming her lungs out, unsuccessfully trying to get between the attackers and the terrified bard. It was a simple equation then. Four bruisers against one man cowering, clearly unable to put up even a meagre defence.\nGeralt decided to even the odds.
journey_1_story_extended_5;Ignore
journey_1_story_extended_5_new;Once the assailants were lying on the ground and the wench covered herself, Geralt felt like something did not add up. The poet had vanished. Quite suspicious, thought the witcher. The so-called “noble propagator of culture” escaped a little bit too hastily. What if he had a guilty conscience? Maybe did something that would put the whole situation in a completely different, less savory light? Fortunately, he did not make it far. Geralt noticed the escapee still in the crowd near the stage. Taking a cue from the thugs, the witcher grabbed him by his colorful attire. The youngster was scared at first, but quickly managed to compose himself. Holding his hat with a heron feather, he bowed politely and introduced himself as Dandelion. He promised that this was just a simple misunderstanding and would gladly answer any questions in a more amicable locale. Actually, he knew a perfect place, a brothel of sorts, where he had conveniently left most of his belongings the previous night. With angry shouts already coming from the stage’s direction, it became pretty clear, he desperately needed help.  \nSo they set off together.\nThe witcher and the bard
journey_1_story_extended_6;It was no great surprise to Geralt that the burly madame who ran “The Little Flower” was already well informed about the situation. Rumors, along with other unsavory things, tended to quickly and easily spread in such establishments. She revealed to him that the wench recently deflowered by Dandelion was the youngest sister of four notoriously overprotective brothers. To make matters worse, she was betrothed to a wealthy albeit extremely unpleasant merchant. A union that their family desperately needed, she assured him. Case closed, thought Geralt. He could now part ways with a clear conscience.\nNonetheless Dandelion, cheerful and seemingly carefree, showed a profound lack of understanding regarding his predicament. The poet, having seemingly just snapped out of a daydream, ordered two portions of groats with onion and a bottle of lousy, yet strong moonshine. “Cheapest possible” the bard muttered under his breath as he tossed over the last coin from his purse. Thus Geralt appreciated the gesture of the meal and refreshment that much more. He only wished that Dandelion would cease talking so much - at least whilst eating supper.\nWell.\nHe did not.\nWith time, however, the witcher had to admit that he was growing less annoyed with the ceaseless prattle, especially after having knocked back a few shots. The bard even taught him a song about maidens… from Vicavaro? Vicovoro?\nSomething like that.
journey_1_story_extended_7;Two brothers burst through the front door, while the other two more subtly entered through the back. Only the cellar remained safe, so with the aid of the nearby courtesans, they quickly made themselves scarce leaving their pursuers none the wiser.\nGeralt listened as four pairs of shoes shuffled on the floor above. The angry voices of the four brothers, searching the brothel, carried through to the cellar. The witcher didn't have the desire to fight once more, and Dandelion ... Dandelion had become mesmerized with thoroughly examining the wine rack.\nTheft seemed a miserable way to show appreciation for aid rendered, which Geralt felt obliged to point out. Outraged, Dandelion mumbled with anger that he hadn’t robbed anyone, but simply made a purchase. It wasn't his fault that the current conditions made it impossible to pay! Nonetheless, he put the bottle down and pulled some writing instruments from his bag. Geralt watched in silence while the bard wrote a letter that was supposed to oblige the mayor of Gulet to settle their bill. The poet claimed that he had not yet received the final payment from his performance, and well, he shouldn’t be expected to go and get the coins at present now, could he? Best to spend it on the wine clearly laid out for them.\nThe witcher found it impossible to argue with such logic - mainly because he had difficulty focusing himself. Therefore, having agreed, he took another bottle out of the rack.
journey_1_story_extended_8;Shhh, he murmured to Dandelion, trying to determine if those above... wait, who were they actually? Geralt couldn't remember. Hmm, never mind, he thought. \nThey have already gone, haven’t they? I guess so, but why risk it? There was a window in the basement that a man could easily squeeze and escape through. There were also bars, but nothing that a little Aard couldn't fix. Just be careful ... Quiet... Plague! What the fuck?! Geralt shook his head, deeply stunned. Meanwhile, Dandelion was just trying to rise from the shifting floor, stumbling over his own legs.\nThe window was gone, leaving a large hole in its place.\nGeralt glanced back to the demolished wall of the “The Little Flower” from his new vantage outside; stooped in a dark street. How did I get here…? - the witcher asked himself. It's probably Dandelion's doing. This fool does everything in... Oh, he took wine with him. Wonderful man.\nGeralt accepted the bottle and, taking a sip, listened to the poet's constant jabbering. What the fuck is he blabbering about? What troubadour from Cidaris? Oh, dumbass, Dandelion. He has to be denser than a rock. This is no other bard's plot, only the unpleasant consequences of a frivolous ride.\nTime passed over the witcher's head for a third time. Where were they actually ...? Geralt was unable to concentrate due the bard's insistent bellowing. Hey poet! Give our ears a rest! And wine! More wine!\nOkay, okay, Geralt waved a hand. Don't fret, I respect you. Duh! I too fucking love you like a brother!
journey_1_story_extended_9;To his surprise, Geralt woke up in the muck of the stables firmly under Roach's watchful gaze. This circumstance would be considered as the norm for him if he hadn't felt so miserable, as if he had lost his natural resistance to toxins. The night's events were a faint blur requiring considerable effort to recall. But what's most unexpected - he had Dandelion's lute under his arm. When the witcher looked at it closer, Roach's blind expression became so strangely human and full of reproach: as if the horse blamed him for a late return, drunkenness, and...\nGeralt winced, suddenly remembering the nightly conquests with Dandelion, especially one idiotic part of their conversation. The bard had moved quite smoothly from the uncomfortable topic of four angry brothers to the issue of brotherly love. Despite this, somewhere between patting themselves on the back and loudly placing male friendship over fleeting affairs, they agreed to leave the city together. However, something different happened. Something unfortunate. Damn... Along with the memories, the witcher became overflown by the strong urge to depart Gulet. Roach was now not only staring at him but also snorting accusingly.\nSighing heavily, Geralt finally stood up, hid the instrument in the horse's saddlebags, and went back to find the manchild musician, poetic liar, an all-around unfortunate idiot.
journey_1_story_standard_1;Ignore
journey_1_story_standard_1_new;Dandelion was fighting.\nThe alcohol he had drunk was still pulsating in his veins, dulling his senses. Throbbing pain reverberated deep inside his skull. His heavy breathing marked the rhythm of his torment.\nThe bard cursed under his breath. His nausea only agreed to relent once the vodka had been forcefully purged. Despite his best efforts, the sheets became victims of this cleansing. So he cursed once more whilst panting heavily until finally making a hesitant step from his bed. Then another despite his feet dancing strangely on the floor with questionable stability. The thirst grabbed him by the throat.\nHe scrambled for a jug of water whilst attempting to recall the previous evening.\nThe spring festival, an age-long tradition stolen from the elves, attracted many to the small city of Gulet. It was a pompous celebration with copious amounts of booze and food, yet, it lacked refined entertainment. Until the local mayor decided to pay a young poet for his renowned talents…\nNot enough, thought Dandelion, licking the last droplets of water from the jug's edge.\nDefinitely not enough.
journey_1_story_standard_10;Wedding.\nThere shall be a wedding, about which the groom, namely Dandelion, had just learned from his future wife. He also finally discovered her name, Kora. At least that much he ought to know before they get married...\nKora, the poet repeated in his thoughts. Quite pretty, he deemed while trying to comfort himself, feeling the noose of happy-ever-after marriage tightening its grip around his neck. The wedding, to make it even more terrifying, was to take place today, in conjunction with the second day of the festival, which, as it turns out, was just one big wedding party. During it, Kora was to be married to the other guy. But a merchant, even a wealthy one, was not comparable to an aristocrat, sighed Julian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount de Lettenhove, better known as Dandelion. He could not recall when he had divulged his title. The noble poet could not even recollect having proposed, though he had a strong impression he never really had. Kora’s previous fiancé had to be a nasty older man, stinking of fish or whatever goods he was known to trade. And he certainly wasn’t very generous, having chosen a group wedding over a more pristine private ceremony. No wonder the poor girl was so quick to seek a more worthy and appropriate partner. Aristocrat, instead of a greedy and decrepit man, how her parents will be pleased. The brothers will finally be calm, and the new would-be spouse will politely and quietly get out of the way.\nThe perfect wedding.
journey_1_story_standard_11;Dandelion hoped the news of the engagement had not yet spread, making it easy to call the whole thing off. Upon opening the door to leave the chamber, the mayor of Gulet appeared and showered the young couple with congratulations, swiftly burying the bard's short-lived aspirations. Passing servants could hardly conceal their crooked smiles while busily helping prepare them for their departure. However, waiting outside, to his dismay, stood a welcoming committee composed of Kora's four brothers demonstratively massaging their knuckles. They graciously agreed not to coat the viscount in tar and sawdust, not unlike a pork chop in egg and flour, so long as he kept his word and joined their family. They graciously offered to help protect the new family castle, which as a viscount, they were expecting him to own. Dandelion swallowed hard. Where the hell was he supposed to conjure a castle from? In truth, it mattered not what these damn half-wits' expected. He had no intention of sticking around long enough for things to get that far. The real problem was: where the hell had his lute gone!?\nThe mayor proudly presented tables overflowing with food, surrounded by mercilessly fiddling second rate musicians. At the far end stood a wedding gate built of flowers and ivy where oaths would soon be exchanged. Beyond, the main market square was being prepared for all the celebratory dancing to come.\nDandelion straightened up, suddenly keenly interested in the official's words.\nThe ceremony was almost upon them.
journey_1_story_standard_12;Dandelion danced.\nHe danced with all his vigor. Following Gulet traditions, the groom was tasked with rescuing his blushing bride trapped within a densely dancing crowd. Only then could the wedding ceremony begin in earnest. The bard, rightfully so, saw this as his last opportunity to escape his predicament. Unfortunately, his soon-to-be brothers-in-law shared the same viewpoint. They had preemptively blocked his likely escape route and were in the process of forcibly leading him towards their sister, Kora.\nDandelion would not be so easily deterred. Participants all around were busily dancing and laughing as they carelessly bumped into one another. Fortunately, this was preventing him from reaching his bride. Lively music filled his ears as the world began spinning around him. Nevertheless, the bard found a rhythm to this madness and proceeded to dance his way out.\nHe passed by the first of the brothers with a few well-timed sharp turns. He smirked, stomping on the second one, who just happened to trip clumsily. The third he took by hand, twisting it in a pirouette only to let it go at the just the right moment for his opponent to lose his balance. The fourth proved to be the most difficult. Dandelion jumped right, jumped left, made a turn, yet the muscle head reacted to his movements like a mirror image. The poet, feeling desperate, decided to attempt a simple trick by taking a step back. The oaf also backed up, so Dandelion continued until finally he just turned around and fled. As he disappeared behind the nearest stall, he heard Kora's desperate cry but did not dare risk looking back.\nNow was his chance to be free, yet first, the poet had to find his precious lute. Thus he began wandering the alleys of Gulet in search of the witcher, feeling resentful and abandoned. In a move of desperation, he made his way to the stables hoping that Geralt had not yet departed this foul city. He groaned miserably upon seeing the horse's absence, then knelt, and bowed his head. The witcher, his steed, and the bard's lute were surely long gone. Dandelion was once again all alone, stripped of his belongings, and unfairly punished by fate.\nIn the height of his despair, a shadow rose behind him. A shadow with a lute in one hand and reins in the other. A shadow with a voice hoarse from vodka, asking the bard to stand the fuck up.\nDandelion turned, overjoyed at this newfound luck.\nHe could sense that this was just the beginning of their journey together.

journey_1_story_standard_2_new;The mayor’s daughter flinched in disgust at the sight of the monstrous mess. Still, she entered further into the chamber in which her father housed their guest. She stopped after reaching the bed and cast a meaningful look at Dandelion.\nHe was accustomed to others looking down their nose at him after witnessing such a trifle. This, however, did not deter him from unleashing a rather charming smile. In fact, it would be hard to find a smile more disarming than Dandelions.\nBut the mayor's daughter sighed with resignation.\nFurthermore, she surprised him with her frigidity as she cut straight to the matter of his performance at the spring festival. She proclaimed that there must be no shortage of poetry and singing - and that his young and, in her humble opinion, questionable talent would be no excuse for failing to provide.\nDandelion glanced at her rather disappointing bosom, about which he had already started composing a spiteful ballad.\nHe grinned once more.

journey_1_story_standard_3_new;After reaching the market square, Dandelion made his way directly to the stage prepared for the spectacle. In order to make up for his tardiness, he began stringing his lute commencing his concert unconventionally. He slid past a stocky tradeswoman, who despite his brilliance, didn’t even bother to give him a second look.\nOne could not say that about the restless crowd forming by the stage.\nExcited whispering began as people stepped aside. Even a white-haired fellow, which the learned bard quickly identified as a witcher, respectfully made room for him. The inhabitants of Gulet seemed capable of recognizing a virtuoso, even before hearing him! Splendid! Dandelion took a deep bow, sweeping the cobblestones with the heron feather on his hat.\nThen, he fulfilled the silent wish of the crowd.\nHe swiped his fingers nimbly across the strings of his lute. Both his steps and his melody were mesmerizing all in attendance. Yet it was clearly his majestic voice that finally won the hearts of his audience. By its conclusion, he saw that he managed to achieve the seemingly impossible.\nThere stood an unfeeling witcher with a tear in his eyes, clearly moved by his poetry.

journey_1_story_standard_4_new;One had to admit that music stimulates the senses. The bard was good with rhymes, knew how to sing, and how to navigate feminine shapes – ergo, he must be the highly desirable type. Oh, how the wenches eagerly displayed their assets to him creating a heated atmosphere that even vodka couldn’t quench.\nWhile Dandelion did not partake in the festivities, he stayed nearby, to accompany one of the more eager looking female inhabitants of Gulet. He soon felt pleasure. One that he longed for since the morning.\nSuddenly he heard an angry roar sending all his prospects of pleasure straight back to hell.\nThe bard was lying under – both the stage and the wench – with his… 'sword' out. Fortunately, he managed to sheath the blade, before the armed assailants entered his hideout. And when they rushed at him, Dandelion did not fall back, successfully defending his lady. Nonetheless, he pretended to be a weakling, so the scoundrels would lower their guard, allowing him to strike at an opportune time. A familiar-looking witcher quickly joined clearly intent on rescuing his favorite performer. Two fearless heroes against some common no good thugs.\nDandelion liked those odds.
journey_1_story_standard_5;Ignore
journey_1_story_standard_5_new;Once the situation was under control, Dandelion kissed the rescued maiden goodbye and walked casually away into the celebrating crowd. He did not say farewell to the witcher, as men have no need for words in such situations. But after a while the bard noticed that he was being followed and turned nonchalantly, stretching out his hand to the man behind him.\nWitcher awkwardly returned the gesture, grabbing his sleeve instead of his palm. Dazed by his brilliance, he barely managed to speak comprehensibly yet it was clear that he wished to converse. It was only after a while that he regained his composure in order to introduce himself as Geralt of Rivia. And what he failed to say aloud, even though it was painfully obvious, was that he needed company. A witcher’s work had to be oh so lonely, with his horse likely his only stable companion. So Dandelion suggested moving to a quieter place - a well-renowned bordello with a great kitchen. For appearances, of course, he used some irrelevant excuse to go there. But in truth, it was just an act of benevolence.\nSo they set off together.\nThe bard and the witcher.
journey_1_story_standard_6;Upon reaching the door of “The Little Flower”, Dandelion came to the conclusion that his assailants must have been sent by some jealous competitor. He dug deep within his memory and recalled a man from Cidaris who had clearly envied his talent. That coward and talentless piece of shit! He would have to be such a wretched dickwad to send hired thugs to kill the more capable poet. Dandelion simply could not allow in good conscience such an affront to remain unanswered. He had the urge to immediately depart in order to seek justice.\nHowever, revenge had to wait, since the bard had a Witcher to entertain.\nGeralt, oblivious to his rudeness, seemed enthralled by the amply bosomed owner. Dandelion wondered when the mutant had last enjoyed... but decided to not follow that thread of thought any deeper. Determined to make the best of the situation, he ordered from a lovely serving maiden a few local delicacies this establishment was famous for. The bard spared no expense on his new friend by procuring a sizeable quantity of their finest vodka. In return, he only hoped that the witcher would open up and start talking more.\nWell.\nHe did not.\nWith time, however, the bard had to admit that Geralt could be quite an amusing companion, especially after having knocked back a few shots. Dandelion even managed to get his real name out of him, which was Geralt Roger Eryk du Haute-Bellegarde.\nExactly that.
journey_1_story_standard_7;Both were pulled by their hands, then pressed into the wall against their backs. It was quite pleasant, that is until the courtesans suddenly disappeared, leaving them alone in the dark.\nDandelion waited until the blackness thinned and the floor stopped tilting so strangely. Women really had no mercy. How could they just leave them like that? After all the cuddles and giggles? He would bet his own lute, the courtesans planned to charge them for services that did not actually take place... Well, at least they left some alcohol.\nDandelion raised a bottle, which seemed to fall into his hand completely by itself. Meanwhile, Geralt mumbled under his breath. First, something about shouting. Second, about paying for the wine that the bard just took. Maybe it was a professional habit of sorts – to look for problems even in the privy. Where were they right now...? It did not matter, really. For Dandelion, such idle talk seemed like nothing more than a waste of time. He was a poet of action, not only of words. So he told Geralt to do something useful already! Look for a way out of this goddamn place or at least drink some more. But the prude grumbled even more. Who would have thought that a witcher could have such moralizing impulses, not to mention a conscience?\nWell, Dandelion didn't want to argue with him – he was definitely too sober for quarrels about the moral relativity of his actions. So he gave in and prepared a generous payment for the services provided by the "The Little Flower".
journey_1_story_standard_8;Ha! Dandelion shouted cheerfully, seeing a dim light in this arse of an... Wait, where were they? Doesn't really matter. The witcher was just raving about escaping, clearly overlooking something more important - their need for more wine.\nStill, this light was an exit, right? Rather strange, though. High above, no stairs... Bars instead of doors? Bulltshit of a... Gods and their virgin mother, what was that?! The bard clutched his head. A sudden blow swept him off his feet and, even worse, sobered him up a little. Seconds later the floor changed places with the ceiling again. Someone ... Geralt? ... threw the poet like a sack of wheat. Ouch! - he groaned, landing on hard stones. It’s… He looked down. Yes! The one last bottle of wine was still under his doublet. He saved it! Oh, what beautiful act of heroism! And great ballad material, the poet did not doubt, because he intended to write it himself. Smearing that bastard from Cidaris in it! Ha!\nHe immediately shared the thought with Geralt. And the witcher laughed! Dandelion couldn't believe his ears. The matter was serious, even deadly serious, and this asshole was croaking, like a wench deflowered by… Wait a minute, it dawned on the bard. He began to hum the tune he sang on stage during the day. Under the stage…? Witcher, he asked loudly, sing with me! It may help us remember...\nNo fucking way, really?! Noooo…. fucking? How could you, Geralt? So disrespectful... And I shared my wine with you, I revealed my secrets to you. For fucks sake, I even love you like a brother!
journey_1_story_standard_9;To his surprise, Dandelion woke up not only in his bed but also with a beautiful girl at his side. This circumstance would typically have been a pleasant turn of events if only his head did not ache as severely as it had the previous morning. The events of the nightly escapade with his newfound witcher compatriot remained foggy at best. To his dismay - his lute was nowhere to be found from among his belongings scattered on the ground. While he was searching frantically for it, the girl's big green eyes glared at him in a disturbingly piercing manner: as if she was enjoying something... too much.\nDandelion frowned, suddenly remembering the more critical part of the conversation with Geralt. The witcher had rather crudely explained to him why the band of thugs was chasing them. From these observations, it became clear that they certainly should do their best to leave the city as soon as possible. Yet instead of being far behind the gates of Gulet, he found himself in the chamber of the mayor's house, in the company of the green-eyed maiden, who at the second glance seemed strangely familiar... The answer to this quandary, he pondered, was likely hidden behind her stare, which had now grown into a disconcerting smile that sent shivers crawling down his spine.\nSeeing no other solution, Dandelion finally decided to ask her about his lute and inquired into the reason she smiled at him so.

journey_2_story_1;Wait, I forgot about the mugs! Let me just grab them from the saddle.\n\nOkay, back to the fire. Now, where do I start? There was so much of it, uncle Vesemir. It’s just hard to recall the first thing⁠—oh! I got it! It’s not from our training or theory lessons though ...\n\nDo you remember the fairy tale about the tabby cat and the red fox? The one where hunters wanted to tear their fur off? Make them into muffs? Of course you remember. How many times have you told it as a bedtime story to the kids of Kaer Morhen? Dozens? Hundreds? Even to Geralt, right? I just can’t seem to imagine him as a child. Was he ever, really?\n\nOkay, I know. He had to be.\n\nAnyway, it was Geralt, who told me this fairy tale when I was just little. Ugh, I didn't like it when others would call me "little" back then, and now here I am doing it myself. Well, that’s the truth: I was little. And lost. And all alone. I had fled from King Ervyll’s men and his nasty son, Kistrin, whom I really, really didn’t want to marry. I mean, his breath alone—eugh! Anyway … that’s how I ended up lost in Brokilon forest. And that’s where I’d have died, if it wasn’t for Geralt. If he hadn’t shown up out of nowhere and killed this overgrown centipede … Oh, I know, I know! Not a centipede, but a yghern, also known as the scolopendromorph. However, you must admit, even in the engravings it looks just like an overgrown centipede.\n\nSo Geralt rescued me from the yghern, and later, when I was lying on the forest floor with the stars blinking at us through the crowns of trees, unable to fall asleep, he told me your bedtime story. About the cat and fox hunted down by humans. In a way, despite not having met yet, it was the first lesson you gave me. It’s pretty good, by the way. While escaping, it's usually better to act like a cat rather than try to be clever like a fox. Just quickly, react without a second thought, without trying some thousand two hundred and eighty-six plots to outsmart the hunter. Do one: hop up the tree. Run away. Don’t look back.\n\nOtherwise you end up as a piece of decorative fur. Like this red muff.
journey_2_story_10;When we handed out gold, we were loud and flamboyant. Made a real show of it. But when we attacked, we did so like rats, or rather… like foxes. Quietly, treacherous, cunning.\n\nThat night, the first sound to break the silence was the crackle of flames. Then it all got so loud. Screams of people fleeing the fire, shouting and wailing. Our mounts, accustomed to such noises, barely reacted to the commotion. The first survivors ran out of a smoking hut. Servants, by the look of their garb. We unsheathed our blades. Whoever the fire couldn’t fry, we were to finish off with our own hands.\n\nSuddenly, a ruckus broke out at the back of the house. Riders spilled from a hidden stable. Among them was the mayor, wearing nothing but his pants. His fat, naked belly bouncing as he rode. Since the servants didn’t really matter to us, we chased down our main target, along with his kin. There were many of them—the mayor apparently lived with his entire family, even his fifth cousin on the distaff side, no doubt. Each Rat had more than enough targets.\n\nI had two.\n\nOne on a big strong gelding, the other on a slender filly. The larger rider sat firmly in the saddle, the smaller one could barely hold on to the mount. I galloped after them, swallowing acrid air. They were within arm’s reach when the wind blew their hoods down. They glanced at me, their flowing hair red in the glow of the fire. Smoke wafted from the flames, and I choked. Coughed wildly until tears welled up in my eyes. I wiped them away to get a better look. I wasn’t sure if I’d just imagined it⁠—or if it was a trick of the light—because… the bigger one, uncle… he looked just like you. And the smaller one was around my age. A kid, really.\n\nI blocked their path, swinging my sword.\n\nThe older one took up the fight. And although he looked like you, he definitely didn’t have your fencing skills. I bested him quickly, with little effort. I threw him from the saddle, pushed him to the ground, then instinctively asked: who are you? As if it mattered. The man began spewing out words chaotically, writhing like an eagle owl caught in a net. The kid clumsily slipped off his horse and clung to his chaperone, even though the old man told him to run away. But the little snot didn’t want to leave his guardian.\n\nThen it hit me.\n\nMentor and student. Like you and me.\n\nThe boy had to be the mayor’s child—had the same chubby face. But his look… his expression… reminded me of… me. Stubbornness, fear, pain. It was all painted across his young face. It mirrored my own from a time not so long ago. Because that night I had a different face. The face of a hunter. Just like those who had chased me long ago.\n\nNow I was the pursuer. I hurt, I stole, I killed...\n\nThe sword fell from my numb fingers. My lips barely moved as I spoke the words: Go away… Run. Fuck off already!\n\nThe elder asked no questions, didn’t attempt to make sense of my sudden change of heart. He quickly grabbed the kid’s hand and stuffed him into the saddle. Immediately after that, he jumped on his mount and urged both horses to a trot.\n\nMotionless, I watched as they galloped away.\n\nBehind me came the tortured howls of the boy’s family.
journey_2_story_11;So, I decided to leave.\n\nThe next night, I collected what few belongings I had and slipped out of camp. I might die a lonely death on the road, but I had to take that chance. I wanted to return to Kaer Morhen. To find you, if not Geralt or Yennefer...\n \nThe leader of the gang stood in my way: Giselher.\n\nHe said he knew what I did. That I let the kid go free. And he didn’t even blame me for that, but the kid’s mentor... he should have died. No adult should be spared. Otherwise, rumours will spread that the Rats can be crossed and afterwards, they will just smack your bottom and send you on your merry way. No, the punishment must be more severe. All traitors must pay with their blood. That was the code⁠—and the reason Giselher stood before me, sword raised.\n\nBut I wasn’t a traitor. Not yet, at least.\n\nThe threat flashed in his eyes: return to camp or betray us. Live or die⁠—what’s it to be? Because if I didn’t retreat, a Rat would die that night. That was just the way of it. And if there was even the slightest chance it would be me, I might have raised my sword. Took up the fight. But he would lose for sure, uncle⁠—I was far more skilled. And I couldn’t use my magic because back then I thought I’d lost it for good. I couldn’t simply jump behind his back and disappear into the night without a trace.\n\nNo, I had to make a choice: kill a Rat… or stay as one.\n\nYou see, uncle... Giselher had always treated me well. He never tried to hurt or take advantage of me. He shared his spoils. Supported us. Took care of our ragtag band of outcasts. The rest of the world could burn to cinders for all he cared, but not us… not his Rats.\n\nI didn’t raise my sword. I feigned a laugh—an artificial peace-maker. Told him to stop being so dramatic. Can’t a girl go for a midnight stroll? Was that not allowed?\n\nGiselher smiled crookedly. Then invited himself along on my improvised walk.\n\nHe never mentioned the kid and his mentor after that, though I assured him I’d kill the old man the first chance I got. Fortunately, I never got that chance, even though I spent many more moons in the Rats’ company.\n\nWeeks passed. Months. More banditry and bloodshed. Until the day came when I finally left them...\n \nThat was the day the Rats all died, uncle—the whole hanza. Even when I chose not to kill, death followed me every step of the way.\n\nThey were slaughtered by the lion from my vision: Leo Bonhart. A bounty hunter. A hired killer who took pleasure in doling out pain, who had his eye on me above all others. He was the scariest man I had ever met in my life. He turned my band, my little foxes, into... into trophies.\n\nAnd I...\n \nI need a short break, uncle. How about another drink, eh?\n\nLast one, I promise.
journey_2_story_12;I killed him, uncle... Bonhart, I mean.\n\nFinally, after so much time had passed. After enduring pain, loss, humiliation. After running so far. To other worlds, even. Other times. And it seemed like I would never stop. Death behind me, in front of me, always in my hand. But you can’t outrun destiny, not for long.\n\nFighting that son of a bitch... it was quite something, uncle. If you saw how I dealt with him, you would be so proud of me.\n\nBut that is a story for another time.\n\nThe fire is dying. My cup is empty, yours... quite full. And I would like to tell you about the final lesson you gave me.\n\nSomeday you have to stop running away. Even if your loved ones shout the opposite.\n\nMy grandmother, Geralt, Yen... you. You all told me to run away. So I ran away. I ran from Cintra and Brokilon, from Thanedd and Tir ná Lia. I ran from hunters and assassins, elves and humans, blacks and reds. I didn’t want to endanger my loved ones, so I escaped to other worlds. I thought you’d all finally be safe if I left you alone. But you still searched for me. Relentlessly. Because that’s how love works. Because when you love someone, you tell them to flee. You gladly face the danger alone, knowing that they are safe.\n\nBut it was my fight as well, uncle. Not just yours.\n\nIn my darkest moments, it was the memory of your care that helped me keep my humanity. But there is so much darkness in this world. You could never have kept me from it⁠—it never works out that way. Evil will always catch up with you. Death will eventually overtake you, surround you. Until you face it. Together with your loved ones... and for your loved ones.\n\nIt took me a long time to comprehend. And so much blood had to flow before I did. Your blood too, uncle. I had to lose you to understand.\n\nBecause that’s when I finally decided to stop running. A year ago.\n\nWhen you died.\n \nWhen I was still a child⁠—a little witcher in a ruined castle full of rats and scary echoes⁠—you said you would not live forever. That you would soon rest in a shallow grave. But no one really believed you. Took it to heart.\n\nYou were eternal to us. Indestructible.\n \nTaught us all so much.\n\nThat’s why I’m here, on the anniversary of your death, paying you tribute by these fading embers, in the shadow of the ruins of your beloved Keep.\n\nBecause even though you are not here in body, you will always be here in spirit, living on through the wisdom you shared and the love you gave.\n\nEternal, after all...\n\nFarewell, Vesemir, last master of Kaer Morhen.\n\nMy mentor.\n\nGoodbye, old friend...\n\nI will never stop missing you.
journey_2_story_2;Who shall we toast to? Geralt? Cheers!\n\nWhew, that’s strong. Waters of Brokilon strong, heh.\n\nYou see, uncle Vesemir ... Already then, which feels like an eternity ago, I realized that I was meant for him. When he was telling the story of the cat and fox, I felt it clearly⁠—this power binding us together even more than the strongest of blood ties. But he turned out to be too stubborn to believe it back then. Dumber than a child lost in the wilderness, you understand? Of course you do. I’ve heard you tell him how stupid he was yourself. \n\nIndeed, uncle.\n\nBut back to your first lesson. The fairy tale.\n\nYou also used it as a bedtime story for me once. I woke up in the middle of the night, unable to sleep through those nightmares of mine. All alone in the dark ... Suddenly, I heard your voice, so warm and caring. The fear vanished at once, disappearing without a trace. You were telling the story differently from Geralt⁠ though—in more detail, yet not at all boring. That's why I never said anything. Sorry to admit, but in the end, this particular teaching turned against the teacher himself. \n\nYes, you heard me right. Against you. \n\nI was a bit⁠—or even a very—unruly child, but we both know you liked it. Although in this case I probably drove you crazy. Just a little.\n\nIt was when the monster from Brokilon had already become a vague memory, the ugly prince Kistrin completely forgotten, and when Cintra ... Cintra utterly ceased to be. The Witchers' Keep became my home. And you, the big bad Wolves themselves, were my family. Yes, indeed, you know that very well. I guess I’m stalling, sorry.\n\nErm, so ... do you remember that time I slipped away? No, not the first. Nor second. \n\nI’d already grown very fond of the place by this time. Sure, it wasn’t much⁠—a bed, a trunk, and that huge, filthy rat I killed and kept as a trophy⁠—but I’d never felt more at home. It was far from the comforts of my chambers in Cintra, sure, but given a choice ... I’d have chosen Kaer Morhen every time.\n\nSo, why run away then, you ask?\n\nI will tell you in a moment. But first, let's pour some more of that brew.
journey_2_story_3;I won’t lie to you, uncle Vesemir. Fear overtook me upon seeing Kaer Morhen for the first time. I was scared as hell.\n\nWhen Geralt found me after Cintra's fall⁠—this time to finally take me with him⁠—I thought I would never feel fear again. That the worst was over ... But, instead of a home, I was in this dark, ruined castle, full of rats and nightmarish echoes. I saw menacing black figures. I saw evil, incredibly shiny eyes staring at me. Glowing in the dark. Suddenly, I heard your voice for the first time, warm and caring, and just like that, the fear had been vanquished. Black silhouettes became friends. Protectors. Glossy eyes expressed curiosity.\n\nIn fact, you all cared. Very much so.\n\nBut some things ... Only you were able to take care of. For instance, the leather jerkin you made for me. It was a little bit crooked ... Well, okay. Very crooked. Truth be told, it looked like the nightmare of any self-respecting tailor. But I still liked it, just as I liked the sword you forged me. Nobody in the keep—absolutely nobody!—forgot about my training. Not once. But only you remembered that a child, even one with my talents, needs proper clothing and a sword befitting her size. You really tried your best, and I appreciated it.\n\nMaybe even too much?\n\nIf I hadn’t wanted to repay you so eagerly, maybe I’d have stayed on the Trail. Not run into the woods instead of sticking to my training. I just thought I'd be able to get back to the stronghold before anyone noticed my disappearance. You see, I'd heard a couple of times how much you wouldn’t mind eating some venison. Sometimes you even mumbled under your breath: if only one of you younger witchers could kindly go hunting, we could have a feast. But nooo… It’s just beans and beans, over and over again.\n\nWell, I was young. And a witcher. Kind of. So I thought it would be a splendid idea to fulfill your wish. There was only one small concern ... that you may not quite acknowledge the accuracy of my reasoning, or worse⁠—you’d have me polishing swords for the whole day, after hearing it. Because you cared, of course. About me and the swords. That's why I decided it would be better to surprise you. With a delicious boar.\n\nAnd I knew exactly where to find one ...
journey_2_story_4;No, not at all.\n\nI didn't go for this boar completely unprepared. I made snares ... All right. I admit. It was no Talgar Winter or even a Wolf Pit. Just a simple trap.\n\nBut it worked!\n\nWell, okay. It almost worked. It sprung. Snap! Crash! However, the boar could somehow still move. Then … the huge beast charged.\n\nCharged straight at me.\n\nStill, I didn't run away, uncle Vesemir. I bravely raised my sword, which you fitted so well to my hand. And then I boldly repeated everything that you all taught me during my training. Lunge, attack, retreat! Half-pirouette, blow, rebound! I balanced with one arm, cutting with the other, jumping over a slippery forest floor with roots reaching out from under the leaves.\n\nThe boar didn’t give a damn about my pirouettes. Someone could even say that he reacted with admirable resistance. I stabbed his hairy rear at least once, but he didn't even grunt. Then, suddenly, he lifted his head⁠, kicked up dirt, and pivoted, charging straight at me again.\n\nI stood my ground, ready to fight. You’d have been proud to see it.\n\nAttack, bounce! Riposte! Half-pirouette! Riposte, full pirouette! Half-pirouette! Jump and cut!\n\nBut the damned swine didn’t even blink. He looked me straight in the eye. Tenacious. What was I to do? My blows seemed ineffective. Pointless even. Like stabbing a sack of millet or a wooden log.\n\nBut no! One must remain calm⁠—breathe⁠—keep going. You taught me that. Stay focused, wait until the last possible moment to evade. Steady … Steady … Pirouette!\n\nUnfortunately, that particular pirouette didn’t work very well. And by this I mean: not at all. He hit me sideways⁠—thwack!—and I flew a good twenty feet into the air. I thumped my back against one of the trees and the sword flew from my hand. For a moment, Brokilon flashed before my eyes, together with the stars. The water rustled in my head.\n\nAnd one thought: Escape! Run away like the cat from your story. Hop up the tree. Don’t look back.\n\nThe boar was in no hurry. At first, he sniffed the sword lying in the dirt. Then he slowly raised his big bulky head towards me⁠—a small girl huddled in a tangle of branches. My ribs burned cruelly, every breath spreading through my body with dull pulsating pain.\n\nHe stood sentinel, this tenacious boar. Staring. Waiting calmly under the tree.\n\nI don't know how much time passed before he got bored. But it was enough for you to notice my absence.
journey_2_story_5;As I waited for our would-be dinner to go away, I recalled the words of a nursery rhyme. You recited it in my mind:\n\n“How doth the little wild boar\nImprove his shining tusks,\nAnd rut them 'gainst the forest floor,\nAnd on the trees' rough husks!\nHow cheerfully he seems to grin\nHow neatly spreads his claws,\nAnd welcomes little lasses in,\nWith gently smiling jaws!”\n\nLouis of Charolleis’ poem is another of many things I know thanks to you, uncle. Unfortunately, it turned out to be of little use in this situation.\n\nAnnoying, really.\n\nHuddled in the large oak tree, I couldn't keep your voice and rhymes out of my head. I had a hard time gathering my thoughts⁠—to come up with some plan. The sight of my muddied sword, trampled on by the boar’s hooves, didn’t help my concentration. It frustrated me. What you would say, seeing the blade in such a state... I couldn’t bear the thought! So, when I was sure the beast was gone for good, all that was left on my mind was the desire to get my weapon back.\n\nI slowly slipped off the tree and took a few careful steps. My ribs still stung with each breath, and my heart thrashed like a bell.\n\nSuddenly, I heard your voice.\n\nNo, not in my head, but for real. Getting closer. You screamed my name, but instead of joy it filled me with panic. I quickly plunged my hand into the undergrowth and grabbed the sword. Its blade shimmering beneath the filth. Then more shouting—my name ringing out all around. Shadows moved among the trees. From the darkness came louder and louder: Ciri! Cirilla!\n\nCirilla Fiona Elen Riannon. Princess of Cintra...\n\nSuddenly, the nightmares came back, even though I was awake. There was a wall of fire before me. I saw a frightening black knight with a winged helmet. I heard the screams of Cintrians being slaughtered.\n\nThere was no “hop” this time.\n\nJust like that, on an impulse, I appeared in the crown of some random pine tree. And then I fell. But just before I hit the ground, it happened again. Another pine tree. This time, I grabbed onto a branch before I plummeted like a stone. Miraculously, I somehow kept hold of my sword. Then I watched in amazement as you traced my footsteps all the way to the large oak tree. How you scratched your head when my trail just... disappeared.\n\nBack then, I didn't know what happened, but I think it was probably the first time I teleported.
journey_2_story_6;How come you didn’t hear about this before? Well, Geralt helped me. Although you were all looking, it was he who finally found me. As always. Destiny, huh?\n\nI know, I know, it's getting old. Just destiny and destiny, over and over again.\n\nAnd beans, ha!\n\nIn any case, I was so confused as I watched you from atop the tree I should never have been in. The world seemed unreal. Time passed at a strange, altered pace. I don't think I prophesied on this occasion, or you surely would have heard me.\n\nBut I had a vision...\n\nA cat ran away with a skulk of foxes. She jumped, hop-hop, from tree to tree. The foxes raced down below. And hunters swarmed from behind. Blacks, reds, hounds, and even one really scary lion.\n\nNeedless to say, the foxes were turned into bloody muffs, while the cat ran and ran and ran away. It seemed she would never stop...\n\nMy eyes snapped open.\n\nGeralt was leaning over me with a stern face, but the faintest of smiles betrayed his facade. He was angry with me, sure, but I was safe and that was most important to him.\nOf course, I started talking pretty quickly. About leaving the Trail, about this grand plan of mine, about the trap that didn’t quite work, and the stubborn boar that refused to yield. I just didn't mention the strange jumps, or talk about the vision. I was afraid⁠—wanted to pretend it hadn’t happened. I thought, instead of dwelling on such things, why not convince him of my original plan? After all, working together as a team, well...  that boar wouldn’t stand a chance!\n\nGeralt disagreed. He said I had probably come across the Old Wild—the caring spirit of the forest. So… no boar. But we didn’t leave empty-handed.\n\nWhile returning to Kaer Morhen, we managed to hunt a hare along the way. It was small, skinny, and stringy, but the soup came out surprisingly tasty. You remember? No, of course not... You didn't even notice the hare when we came back. You didn't care about fatigue or hunger. You were more interested in me⁠—the fear that echoed in my voice and the bruising on my ribs. You immediately took care of my wounds and started brewing some healing potions.\n\nYou never touched the hare soup. Not even a taste. Instead, you made me eat it all to regain my strength.
journey_2_story_7;Fairy tales and nursery rhymes. All these fat volumes read together. Fencing lessons… Anything else? Hmm, maybe for a change something you didn't teach me?\n\nA lot of things. Right. But this is quite a crucial one.\n\nContrary to appearances, neither you nor Geralt showed me how to kill. How to defend myself, yes. To survive, sure. To not give up… But not how to take someone's life in cold blood.\n\nBecause to fight is not the same as to kill. You know that well enough.\n\nSo you taught me how to swing a sword and to pirouette. How to dodge and block. Well, even how to attack! How to cut through a leather bag. A straw mannequin. An overgrown rodent. But not how to kill another human...\n\nThat I had to learn myself. Much later.\n\nBy the time of my first, I had long left Kaer Morhen⁠. I had attained some basic education at the Temple of Melitele, where I received magical training under the supervision of Yennefer. But, once again, just as I started to warm to my new surroundings, I was whisked away to someplace else. This time, I found myself on the island of Thanedd.\n\nDuring the coup.\n\nI won’t recount the whole incident for you, uncle⁠. You already know the events well enough.\n\nBut it was terrible. One moment I was asleep in bed, the next I was kneeling among dead bodies. Suddenly, Thanedd became a second Cintra. People screamed, fought desperately, and died brutally before my eyes. Whether by sword or sorcery, death is ugly. So I ran from it. Especially as those I loved had disappeared. Left me to be hunted—again. And in the chaos, in this mad dash for my life, I found myself in Tor Lara. At the portal. It attracted me, summoned me, even whispered... And there was no other escape, only this shining oval. So, I closed my eyes and stepped into it. Then there was a blinding brightness and a furious whirlpool; a breathless blast that crushed my ribs and sucked the air from my lungs.\n\nI ended up completely alone. In the middle of nowhere. The warped portal had spat me out in some random desert, where I was certain I would die. But I didn’t. I found my way out—you know I somehow always do. Unfortunately, I ran straight into the hands of mercenary bandits…\n\nIt seemed no matter how far I ran, trouble would always find me. Capture looked to be my fate once more. And as we both know by now⁠, it’s pretty hard to outrun destiny. But it was not to be. Thanks to the help of a skulk of foxes, I managed to escape.\n\nI had always wondered when the foxes of my visions would show up, who they’d be, what they’d be like… As it happens, they turned out to be a rather violent hanza.\n\nYes, uncle. I want to tell you about a past that I'm not proud of at all. About deeds I have never fully forgiven myself for. About the time when I became a common bandit. \n\nA Rat.
journey_2_story_8;So, how did I join the hanza? Well, while the mercenaries who had captured me were feasting with another gang, the Rats attacked the inn. They did so because that other gang had imprisoned one of their companions⁠—had him tied up next to me.\n\nAnyway, considering the circumstances, the Rats seemed like the best of two bad options, so I helped them⁠—to help myself.\n\nAnother fight broke out, as if the one on Thanedd wasn't enough already. Along with the Rats, I ended up running away again.\n\nThat's when... I...\n\nI was racing through the village away from that damned inn, trying to escape the chaos.\n\nTrying to avoid being captured at all costs.\n\nSuddenly, one of the settlers emerged from a pigsty. He attacked me with a spear.\n\nWhat happened next haunted my dreams for a long time. I remember everything. Every move. The instinctual half-turn that saved me from the spearhead, the settler that didn’t have time to block my riposte⁠—my cut was simply too fast.\n\nFor a moment, I saw his mouth open, ready to scream. I saw an elongated bald forehead, pale above the line where a hat must have protected it from the sun. Now that paleness was spattered red. He howled and wheezed, fell and convulsed among the straw and dung. Blood spurted from him like a stuck pig, and my stomach rolled up into my throat.\n\nI tried to justify what happened. Explained to myself that it was the fault of my training. Pure muscle memory. That I didn't want to take anyone's life. It was only self-defence.\n\nAnd that was the truth... at least that first time.\n\nLater, when I had officially joined the Rats, that changed. I changed. I started killing for reasons not worth killing for. Certainly not worth dying over.\n \nBut this didn’t happen right away.\n\nYou could say I stalled for a long time. Pretended to be a killer in front of the others. During subsequent skirmishes and attacks, I used ferocious-looking blows during combat. Made them look deadly. But in reality, they were only meant to incapacitate. To overwhelm the opponent before death was necessary. Like that time with the bailiff transport...\n\nWe caught them near a fallen bridge. The Rats had killed the entire convoy, except for one soldier. The one that started to run away, but upon seeing me… turned his horse and rushed to attack… missing the mark. Even though he blocked, expecting a counter, I got him. A cut straight to the mouth. Not fatal, but nasty, just like the one that would eventually disfigure my face...\n\nI wonder if he lived to tell someone his story?\n\nI really hope so.
journey_2_story_9;As you can see, uncle, people were eagerly jumping onto my sword. Maybe because I was the youngest Rat. Or I just looked the least threatening. Whatever the reason, death was a constant presence. Following my every step. Ahead of me. Surrounding me. Always in my hand.\n\nI often thought about Kaer Morhen, especially at night. The home I wanted to return to with all my heart. But I was scared. I had lost so much on Thanedd, uncle. Or so I believed back then. I felt powerless.\n\nI didn’t want to forfeit what little I had left. End up all alone.\n\nBut I could hope… I suspected you might still be there. I dreamed of returning to the stronghold—seeing your warm smile upon my arrival. I charted maps and trails in my mind, wishing to make it so. But you know how it is. In times of war, loneliness on the road means a swift and brutal death.\n\nAnd I didn’t want to die. So I clung to my colourful gang. Hid within their ranks like a real rat. Just… went through the motions to get by.\n\nUntil the night we attacked the village of New Forge.\n\nWe snuck in with a single purpose: set fire to the mayor’s house. Burn it to the ground. You see, he was the fool who gave our companion to the mercenaries—the ones from the tavern. And we needed people to know that punishment for such an offence was inevitable. The penalty…? Death, of course.\n\nBut you must understand, uncle, it wasn’t all villainy. The Rats’ reputation was just as good as bad. For we—the children of contempt—shared most of our spoils. We distributed cattle, grain, and cloths from the Nilfgaardians to the villages. Helped people. We paid handfuls of gold and silver to tailors and craftsmen for what we cherished above all else—weapons, clothing, and ornaments. And in return for our generosity, they fed us. Hosted us. Hid us. And even when smitten to a bloodied pulp, they didn’t reveal our hideouts. They were loyal.\n \nEventually, the prefects placed a hefty reward on our heads.\n\nThose with more greed than sense started to go fishing for Nilfgaardian gold. Just like the mayor of New Forge, who was blinded by his lust for coin, sealing his fate and condemning his own village to ruin in the process.\n\nBut what happened that night… amid the flames and chaos… snapped me back to reality. Made me realise what was truly important. Convinced me that I had to leave the Rats as soon as possible.\n\nIf I could.

journey_3_story_1;'They were all dead. Except me, of course.' Galanthea's tone grew sombre. 'But everyone else… Everyone I had ever loved, up till that moment...'\n\nThe flames of the campfire danced in her big brown eyes, as she panned over the gawking faces of her impromptu audience⁠—a company of dwarves, a halfling tailor, a merchant, a soldier, and some colleagues from Oxenfurt. No one looked poised to interrupt her story, and so she continued…\n\n'We had been travelling through the countryside, a routine journey on our annual circuit of estates, taverns, brothels⁠—whoever had enough spare coin to shell out on entertainment. It was a cold, early morning and a layer of mist hung around us, making the woods seem ethereal. A beautiful sight, really. On the wagon up front, some of the actors were being rather boisterous. Joel and Elba. They were jesting loudly, still drunk from the night before. I remember it clearly because that was when they came...' she paused, allowing the suspense a moment to crescendo, '… the flying terrors.'\n\nThe halfling tailor's eyes widened, captivated. Some of the dwarfs shook their heads and mumbled obscenities under their breath. The others, however, went back to draining their mead and mumbling to each other, uninterested by the talk of monsters—attacks were a common occurrence, and they'd heard it all before.\n\n'Suddenly, the atmosphere shifted. Birds stopped chirping; the gentle breeze fell deathly still. The mist seemed to grow thicker, more imposing—its wispy tendrils weaving between the trees, spreading across the glade. Consuming us. In a matter of moments, we were all engulfed by the thick fog, and all I could see was a blanket of white before me⁠. Nothing else. Not another soul.\n\nSome of the lads thought it was rather amusing at first⁠—I could hear them laughing. But that didn't last long. A fearful cry silenced their merriment, followed by a harrowing shriek. Then another. Shadows swooped through the mist above our heads, all around. I quickly jumped off the wagon and scurried underneath to hide. Cowering in the wet mud, I listened to all my friends die. Nightmarish screams as they were picked off one by one, with nothing I could do⁠—I was just a child, you see.'\n\n'How did you escape?' The soldier interjected, impatient and anxious to know the outcome.\n\n'Shush it, you. Let the lass finish,' barked a dwarf.\n\nShe nodded in thanks and tossed some twigs into the flames. 'I could no longer hear any of my friends. All that remained was the monstrous cawing from high above as I trembled in my hiding place, crippled with fear. Then... thud! Something landed on the wagon; perched on its edge. A long, scaly tail snaked down in front of me—a guttural rasping right above my head, so very close. I don't believe in any gods⁠—never have⁠—but in that moment of despair, I surely prayed⁠. And as if on cue, lightning forked through the fog, and a spectrum of colour whirled towards the cart. A piercing shriek as the tail fell into the dirt, severed at the rear. All around, caws gave way to screeches and frenzied yelps. Flapping silhouettes in the mist exploded into balls of gore as the stench of charred meat flooded my nostrils, choking me. One of the winged demons fell from the sky and landed in the blood-soaked earth, its grotesque body scorched and smouldering; writhing feebly, yowling, trying hopelessly to fly before collapsing back onto the ground, lifeless. Then he appeared from the mist—the man who had saved me.'\n\n'—Heh!' A cloaked figure, slumped against a tree just outside the glow of the fire, grunted and spat with contempt. Galanthea eyed the hooded man for a moment, pondering on his boorish gesture, then decided to ignore it and conclude her tale.\n\n'With all the creatures dispatched, the rescuer stood before me, calm and composed. Pure energy crackling around his fingertips, he wiped the monsters' blood from his sword and sheathed the blade. Then knelt before me, and in a resounding, mellifluous voice, he soothed my dismay: "Fear not, little one. You're safe."\n\nAnd there it was. On that accursed day, within the fog, among the bodies of my loved ones, when all hope was lost... my prayers were somehow answered. But not by any god, oh no.' Galanthea gleamed. 'By a renowned mage named... Alzur.'
journey_3_story_10;The witcher made his way back down the dusty road...\n\nFortunately for the caravan, the only thing awaiting them was a steady supply of animal remains strewn across the fields; their bones picked clean. Victims of the drought, he suspected. Poor bastards.\n\nHe approached the inn at the crossroads⁠—the caravan should have arrived by now, and would no doubt stay for the night. Then, just half a day more and they'd be at Maribor city… He furrowed his brow, contemplating: why even come this far after already collecting his coin? His employer was dead, and he no longer had any obligation. Not a professional one, at least...\n\nHe hawked and spat into the dirt. Just a way to kill time, he concluded. Just something to do...\n\nAs he neared the inn, he saw familiar horses and wagons out front⁠—as expected⁠—but, the scene was off; something not quite right...\n\nHe trotted over carefully and surveyed the indentations of the disturbed dirt from horseback, then slid from his saddle and crouched to get a closer look. Some sort of struggle, he deduced. Specks of dried blood⁠—no doubt about it. He frowned. 'Fuck.'\n\nThe witcher threw his steed a casual command—'Stay’—then strode towards the inn.\n\nOutside, a burly man in a dirty yellow tunic was hunched on a bench, playing with a dagger and glaring at the approaching witcher. He stood up and puffed out his chest. 'Sorry, chum, we's closed.'\n\nHe ignored the warning and continued. The dull-looking man stepped in front of the door, blocking the way. 'You lookin' for a beatin'? I said we's fuckin'—'\n\nWithout hesitation, the witcher launched his fist into the man's gut, dropping him to the ground. Winded, the dullard rolled around, gasping for air.\n\nThe witcher threw the man a casual command⁠—'Stay’—then entered the inn.\n\nInside, the group of would-be bandits were gathered around tables, sifting through the trinkets they'd collected from the caravan. The murmur of their conversation simmered to silence as the witcher entered, and they collectively stared at the intruder.\n\n'Where are they?' the witcher asked, calm and composed.\n\nAfter a brief moment of surprise, the lanky woman snatched her crossbow from the table.\n\n'Don't bother…'\n\nShe tautened the string and hurriedly notched a bolt as the witcher rolled his eyes. 'Who… who the heck are you?' she demanded.\n\nHe cracked his neck and placed his hand on the pommel of his sword. 'Where are they?'\n\nThe woman narrowed her eyes, then nodded to the others, spurring them to spread out and surround the witcher.\n\n'What's the plan then? Hold up here? Prey on passers-by? How long you think that'll work, huh? Before they send the guard and you all dance a jig on the end of a rope.'\n\n'Nah… they're too busy dealin' with the riots in the city. Drought's caused right anarchy. They ain't comin' out here no time soon⁠—no chance. Now... piss off 'n leave us be, 'fore I drop ye.'\n\nThe witcher tilted his head, listening intently. 'Hmm...' He heard muffled voices from down below. 'Why capture them? Why not just rob 'em and let 'em be on their way? Simpler.'\n\n‘Cos⁠— That's⁠— Cos⁠— Well... 'her eyes flicked around as she thought. 'None⁠— none o' your fuckin' business, that's why.' She tensed her aim. 'Last warning, I swear.'\n\n'My advice…' The witcher's grip tightened around the hilt of his sword. '... Cut your losses, and go home.'\n\nThe woman blinked rapidly, considering, then slowly fingered the trigger.\n\n'Don't…' the witcher warned, bracing himself.\n\nHer eyes widened⁠⁠—she'd made up her mind.\n\nThe witcher unsheathed his sword.\n\nTWANG!\n\nThe bolt flew.\n\nIn one fluid stroke, he caught the projectile mid-flight with the flat of his blade.\n\nCLANG!\n\nThe bolt reeled sideways through the air and hit one of the gang members in his throat. He let out a half-gasp, gargled blood, then collapsed onto the floor. The woman screamed⁠—'AAAH!'—then fell quiet with shock, the crossbow slipping from her fingers.\n\nSilence lingered, then, finally, the witcher panned over the onlookers, scowling. 'Anybody else?'\n\nThey immediately dropped their weapons and displayed the palms of their hands in submission, shaking their gawping faces from side to side. A raggedy man stammered, 'P-p-please, sir.'\n\nThe witcher casually sheathed his sword. 'Go on… fuck off.' \n\nThe band cautiously shimmied towards the front door; their eyes fixed on the witcher. When they were close enough, they rushed outside, stumbling over each other as they fled.\n\nThe witcher looked down at the blood pooling around the unfortunate wretch. He sighed, then clicked his tongue regretfully. 'Unlucky, pal...'\n\nHe surveyed the room and found a large trapdoor nestled in the corner.\n\nA hushed voice came from beneath. 'Witcher?'\n\nHe lifted the hatch and saw Galanthea at the foot of a wooden ladder, peering up. She smiled at the sight of him and nodded with gratitude.\n\nThe witcher glowered at her for a moment, then smirked ever-so-slightly. 'Two for two.'
journey_3_story_11;Atop a shallow bank beside the inn, the witcher shovelled out another heap of dirt from the grave he was digging. For a moment, he was back within the grounds of Alzur's castle, burying the mutilated bodies of his fallen brethren. The mage's voice echoed in his head: 'It's a sorry affair, I know. But it has to be done, my boy. It must!' He squeezed his eyes shut, quashing away the memory, then resumed his task.\n\nNearby, Galanthea sat upon a bench hewn out of a felled oak, fondly watching the soil-spattered witcher. 'Perhaps he wanted a pyre...'\n\nHe shot her an unimpressed side-eye. She smirked.\n\n'You're proving quite the knight in shining armour, I must say.'\n\nHe kicked the shovel into the earth with a grunt and scooped out another load.\n\n'Perhaps I should dig out my fiddle... compose an epic ballad about your escapades.'\n\nHe huffed.\n\nGalanthea pondered for a moment. 'Of course, I would have to find some suitable words to rhyme with "witcher"....' she paused. 'Or... with "Madoc"...'\n\nThe witcher froze, then slowly lifted his head towards her.\n\n'He spoke ever so fondly of you. The last time we met.'\n\nThe witcher vaulted out of the grave, threw down his shovel, and took several aggressive strides towards Galanthea. 'He tryin' to meddle in my affairs now? Follow me around? That it? What are you⁠—his loyal lapdog?'\n\n'I'm no man's operative, my dear. 'Twas fate alone that entwined our paths. Yet, the very first moment I laid my eyes upon you… oh, I knew for sure who stood before me.'\n\n'Horseshit!' The witcher feigned a guffaw. 'Typical! He can't fathom anything being outside his control, can he!' He scoffed, 'Has to pull at the fuckin' strings!' He cracked his neck. 'So, what? He sent you here to soften me up? Coerce me to come crawling back to his fanciful fellowship, eh? Well, it ain't gonna happen. I don't belong there⁠—never have. It's all a blasted farce! I'm just a killer⁠—a good-for-nothin' cut-throat⁠—I'll never be anything more than that.'\n\nGalanthea let his anger hang, then tilted her head. 'Oh, Madoc… Why spew shit you know ain't true?' She smiled. 'Maybe you're just delusional. Or utterly blind...'\n\nMadoc seethed. 'Don't you...'\n\nHer eyes grew sombre. 'You must know, he really wants⁠—'\n\n'Fuck off!'\n\n'You're so very special to him. You can't imagine, even after all this time, being one of the first⁠—'\n\n'I'm not his pet⁠—his fuckin' plaything.'\n\n'No, no, of course⁠—'\n\n'He needs to let go, dammit!'\n\nGalanthea paused, considering her words. 'Aye, you're quite right, he does. He needs to let a lot of stuff go. But so do you.' She eyed Madoc, then patted the space beside her. 'Come. Sit.'\n\nThe witcher's scowl lingered as he clenched his jaw, quivering with frustration. Then he gave in and perched himself on the edge of the bench.\n\n'You spend an awful lot of time brooding, don't you?' She let the moment linger, his silence becoming the answer he did not want to give. She continued facetiously, '"Oh, woe is me! I'm stuck as a monster, a freak!"... eh? Well, boo-fucking-hoo!'\n\nMadoc faced her, taken aback by her tone.\n\n'Grow up, lad, and get over it.'\n\nHe glared at her, then veered his gaze out over the prairie.\n\n'I always duck the question of why I stopped being a bard. Wanna know why?' She didn't wait for an answer. 'Because it's a story not worth telling, and certainly not worth hearing. There's no charming adventure to be found, no magical moment, no grand finale. Just… a simple truth that doesn't sit well with most folk. You see, I never even wanted to be a bard in the first place, it was but a self-imposed obligation... to honour the memory of those long past. I kept on, for decades, singing to strangers, playing that damned fiddle... miserable and unfulfilled. Propelled onwards by guilt⁠. Surviving when others have not can be... a heavy burden to bear. But, of course, I needn't tell you that…'\n\nThe witcher mumbled something unintelligible.\n\n'I was just depriving myself of a life well-lived, for a futile cause born from penance.'\n\n'That's on you,' the witcher muttered.\n\n'Aye. Aye. And it took me a good long time to realise it. You cannot allow the past to dictate your future. It's a helluva waste of life, to be held prisoner by the dead and buried. Even Alzur—with all of his wits and longevity⁠—still hasn't figured that one out. He's obsessed with a time long gone, one he cannot let go of. But that's his choice to make. And you, Madoc, have your own.' She paused. 'Alzur isn't the one shaping your clay, my dear. Not for a long time now…'\n\nMadoc remained silent, wallowing in thought.\n\n'You've been through hell. And I feel your pain, I do. But do not make the mistake of thinking you have a monopoly on suffering. On the contrary, you're in quite the privileged position. Most folks have to eke out a sorry excuse for a living, barely surviving from one day to the next. Denied any aspirations. Then⁠—poof!—they die, and it was as if they were never here at all. But you, you can go places and do things most of us could only dream of. You can accomplish incredible feats, make the world a better place, and be remembered for it. To renounce that gift because of bad blood and stubbornness... well, it would be a grave affront to all those less fortunate.\n\n'So, I say this to you: Alzur and his vision be damned⁠. Heck, your fallen brothers be damned as well. This is about you. Take control of your destiny and shape your future for the better, before it's too late. Because, Madoc, you are afforded the luxury to do so.'\n\nThe witcher slouched forwards, his eyes glazed over with contemplation.\n\nGalanthea held out her hand, palm upturned, then glanced towards the sky. 'Looks like you best finish that hole of yours.' Seemingly from nowhere, slate-grey clouds had assembled across the once-spotless sky, and a light rain was falling. 'Something tells me you don't have very long.'
journey_3_story_12;The innkeeper tumbled out through the front doors and dropped to his knees in the mud, arms extended jubilantly towards the heavens. 'A miracle⁠—praise be!' He closed his eyes and smiled, basking in the refreshing drizzle. 'So many years forsaken, so many⁠—' A thought hit him, and he hopped to his feet and rushed back inside. Moments later, he reappeared, followed by the halfling and the dwarf, their arms all overflowing with copper pots and pans.\n\nMadoc and Galanthea, still sitting upon the nearby hillside, smiled in unison at the sight of them frantically collecting rainwater in the various vessel-like wares.\n\nThe witcher's gaze ascended towards the sky. He eyed the clouds warily as they drifted outwards from a singular point in the distance. Strange, he thought, furrowing his brow. He scratched his bristly throat and cocked his head to the left. 'Alzur…'\n\n'... Aye.' Galanthea said after a moment.\n\nHe brushed away the thought and diverted the conversation. 'How... How did he lift your curse? You never said.'\n\nGalanthea mulled over the question, then sighed sedately. 'That, my dear, is a tale for another time. And one I won't relish the telling of, that's for sure.'\n\nThe witcher frowned.\n\nShe smiled softly. 'Let's just say: life sometimes leaves you with no good choices. No clear avenue towards respite. But a choice must always be made, and the consequences faced, whatever they may be. You'll do well to remember this, witcher: consequences, if shunned, are wont to accrue. And in the end, the piper must always be paid, one way or another.' She gazed at some of her travelling companions dancing with glee in the rain outside the inn. 'Few of us make it through life unsullied, Madoc. And those that do tend to die young. Best we can do is to try and balance the scales, somehow, before we take our final breath.'\n\nThe witcher snorted. 'Life is debt.'\n\n'Aye.'\n\nThe sounds of joyous celebration were suddenly engulfed by an ear-splitting boom.\n\nRUMBLE!\n\nCRACK! \n\nFlashes of blinding light, both green and red, illuminated the landscape.\n\nMadoc jumped to his feet and cast his gaze out across the fields to the horizon, where the walls of a far-off Maribor city could be seen reaching above the freshly sodden plains. 'What's he doing?'\n\nHigh above, the voluminous clouds tumbled unnaturally across the sky, growing darker as they shifted ominously from the capital.\n\nSuddenly lightning flashed and forked over the dismal vista, swiftly followed by the bellowing rumble of thunder. Light rain gave way to a torrential downpour, and the breeze burst into a stormy gale. The grey-black clouds whirled in the distance, circling a hole in the sky that was opening up. Sinuous rifts of pulsating light veined outwards from the expanding breach, casting a spectrum of vibrant colours dancing across the horizon.\n\nGalanthea and Madoc joined the travellers that had congregated on the crossroads to watch the distant chaos unfold.\n\n'Oh, no, oh, no,' the halfling muttered to himself. 'Oh, dear.'\n\n"Tis a portal!' the dwarf yelled over the sound of belting rainfall. 'Just like Ellander!'\n\n'P-p-ploughin' hell!' The soldier's face turned white, and his eyes widened with disbelief. 'It cannot be…'\n\nFrom deep within the faraway cyclone, an enormous and horrific form snaked downwards from the portal. Its giant elongated body, adorned with rows of hooked limbs on either side, wrapped and writhed in the sky, descending upon the city of Maribor.\n\nThe ground trembled as the terrible monstrosity crashed into the ill-fated metropolis. \n\nThe gaping hole snapped shut in its wake, and the spectrum of vivid light faded from existence. All that remained was the blackened clouds, the blackened landscape, and the blackened silhouette of the colossal monster illumined by the spasmodic lightning. Each flash revealed a fleeting glimpse of the massive centipede wreaking havoc upon the city; its immense mandibles snapping violently as it constricted its long thorax around protruding towers, shattering and smashing them to rubble.\n\nDammit, Madoc thought. Dammit to hell.\n\nHe squinted through the rain towards Galanthea. Her big brown eyes, soft and sombre, pleaded to him. 'Go,' she mouthed. 'He needs your help… we all do.'\n\nWithout hesitation, Madoc bounded over to the hitching post and vaulted onto his steed's saddle. Clenching the reins, he turned one last time towards those he had rescued. The halfling was busy using a saucepan to shield himself from the rain. The dwarf was barking something utterly lost amidst the backdrop of the now thrashing downpour. The soldier, holding onto the innkeeper for balance, was shaking his head woefully from side to side. Galanthea, her sorrowful eyes betraying her fear, smiled hopefully at the witcher and nodded with appreciation.\n\nMadoc returned the gesture, then pivoted his mount onto the darkened road, spurred the horse on, and galloped towards Maribor city. Towards the blackness. Towards the lightning. Towards the all-consuming monster and savage ongoing carnage. Towards destruction, death and chaos incarnate.\n\nOnwards he rode, towards his maker.\n\nOnwards, towards his fate.
journey_3_story_2;‘Is that why you stopped being a bard, then? Quit being Snowdrop?’ asked the halfling tailor.\n\n‘Ach, goodness, no!’ Galanthea replied. ‘‘Twas the moment I started!’\n\n‘Then, why finish? At your age⁠—you could have written a hundred ballads by now. A thousand even!’\n\nGalanthea tilted her head and contemplated. She’d been posed that question many times since she’d hung up her fiddle. ‘Because life changes, dear fellow. Life changes, and ofttimes it’s best to change with it.’\n\nThe halfling contorted his lips, dissatisfied with the obvious evasion, but reluctantly nodded in agreement.\n\n‘Tell us more about this renowned mage of yours...’ the soldier requested, leaning forward.\n\n‘Bollocks to “renowned!”’ snapped one of the men in the back who, not so long ago, seemed utterly indifferent to Galanthea’s story. ‘Infamous, more like! The guy is a rebel and a madman, with a price on his head, not some heroic saviour of little girls.’\n\n‘Oi, watch yer lip there, lad!’ The dwarf stepped to her defence again. ‘After all, he saved the lassie. He couldnae be all bad.’\n\n‘But why?’ interjected the merchant, flapping his arms. ‘Why go out of your way to save a child—no offence⁠—surely, a sorcerer has far more important endeavours to occupy his time? Was he just passing by and happened upon the ruckus? Figured “why the hell not?” and jumped right in? Seems rather far-fetched, if you ask me.’\n\n‘No one did. And use yer noggin’, would ye?’ spat the dwarf. ‘Mages are all-seeing! And can teleport! In a snap, they can be here, there, any-bloody-where. Any eejit knows that.’ \n\n‘Yes, you’re absolutely right, it would take an idiot to think that. But that’s beside the point in any case. The “why” is far more significant than the “how” of it. So, I must reiterate... why?’\n\n‘Because that’s what heroes do, isn’t it?’ chimed in another onlooker.\n\nGalanthea smiled and sipped some of her wine. She always enjoyed a heated debate and knew full-well what a sensitive topic this was. \n\n‘Yeah! They step in and save people!’\n\n‘Not likely! Mages are cold. Calculated. What do they care of our troubles? How does saving us serve them?’\n\n‘Maybe he was hunting them flyin’ beasties for, like, ingredients or summin’?’\n\n‘Nah, they gots them ‘pprentices for stuffs like that⁠.’\n\n‘Perhaps it was just a bit o’ fun, then, recreation or⁠—’\n\n‘Vainglory!’ The coarse, scornful voice ripped through the campsite, stopping the discussion dead in its tracks. ‘And fuckin’ pride!’ The ensemble of travellers turned in unison and gazed at the cloaked man, who still lurked at the edge of the site, slouched against the foot of a withered oak. It was the first thing he had said since joining the caravan, just after Vizima. Most of the party had pegged him for either a mute or a dullard. Their eyes lingered on the hooded man, awaiting a followup to his brash outburst. But they were left wanting, as he remained silent and stoic amid the shadows.\n\n‘I believe⁠— hum, hum,’ the halfling started, breaking the awkward lull. ‘Sorry. Hum. I believe he wanted to prove himself. Alzur. He wanted to be gallant. Like a knight.’\n\n‘Oh, really now?’ Galanthea replied curiously. ‘And what brings you to that conclusion?’\n\n‘Well, you see, one of my ancestors, would you believe it, worked on the very same estate where Alzur was brought up⁠.’ He dabbed his sweat-beaded brow with a tattered handkerchief. ‘Sometimes we’d hear tales about the old days; stories from the past, you know? Growing up, I heard various⁠—’\n\n‘Aye, aye! Enough scene-setting,’ Galanthea interrupted, ‘crack on with it.’\n\n‘Yes. Right. Apologies. Well...  Erm... Well… You see, it all began with a child surprise…’
journey_3_story_3;'No, no, no⁠, not that sort of child surprise! Apologies, poor choice of words. I meant, more like...  a "bastard surprise", if you will—for when Alzur was but a babe, he was left upon the doorstep of a noble estate on the outskirts of Maribor city, accompanied by a simple note: "His mother perished, he's one of yours."'\n\nThe tailor hopped off the felled trunk he'd been perched upon and wandered around the campfire, poorly attempting to imitate a theatrical narrator. \n\n'It was assumed his mother had been a courtesan from the nearby house of ill repute. However, the various so-called noblemen of the estate were all notorious for their debauchery, leaving no way to determine with certainty his father's identity. None dared risk throwing the potential fruit of their loins to the wolves and thus it was agreed to take him in. But it was not a happily-ever-after. No man dared show him undue affection, for fear it could be seen as an admission of guilt, whilst the ladies of the court pitied the poor boy and ensured he was cared for. But pity is a poor substitute for love.\n\nNot to mention, he was shunned and mocked by his siblings for being baseborn, and so would tuck himself away in the estate's library. He would read day and night, absorbed by wondrous worlds and brave tales of mighty heroes. One volume in particular captured his imagination, oft being drawn to read each week afresh. A Guide to Chivalric Virtues by... Sir Mateo of Metinna, if I recall. He was utterly and completely captivated by the deeds of noble knights and the chivalric virtues which inspired them to valour...\n\nAnd thus, he would incessantly wander around the estate and surrounding countryside, seeking trials to prove his virtues⁠—honour, compassion, generosity, that sort of thing, you know—like a proper knight of old. Helping wherever he could. Hopelessly trying to win folk's approval.\n\nHowever, being just a child, the virtue of valour eluded him. How could he possibly prove his bravery like the courageous knights of the stories? Hmm?\n\nWell, one day, on the way to market to run some errands, Alzur happened upon a wagon set upon by bandits. Any other lad would have simply run, called for help maybe. But not him. He needed to prove his valour. So he stepped in and foolishly confronted the brigands...\n\nThey found Alzur hours later, unconscious, bloody and beaten, lying at the side of the road. He'd taken quite a thrashing from which it took him weeks to recover! But recover he did. To everyone's surprise, the encounter left him even more determined to prove his worth! Only this time, he didn't wait for an opportunity to arise... the mad boy went looking for it.\n\nAnd once again, they found him pummeled, tossed in a ditch, within an inch of his life! But even that was not enough to dissuade the boy. More trouble followed. More thrashings. More recoveries. Again and again, so on and so forth, until one day something quite unexpected happened.\n\nAlzur had once more gone missing, prompting the noblemen to reluctantly commence their search at the behest of their better halves. But once finally discovered, they didn't happen upon a clobbered child, not this time. Oh no, he was unscathed, standing motionless in a back alley, in shock, staring at the corpses of three burly men lying in a heap in front of him, their crisp skin scorched black.\n\nTurns out the boy had chaos coursing through his veins. A great power that, lain dormant within him, had finally been ignited and unleashed. He could channel magic... but he could not yet control it. And so the family, fearing for their safety, called upon the services of a powerful mage to guide the boy, to help him harness his potential. And he did. Under guidance, he became a gifted and famous sorcerer—the very one we debate over this night.\n\nBut I believe that childhood still influences him; drives him to uphold those knightly virtues that captivated him all those years ago⁠—ingrained deep within him, see. And that's why he stepped in to save the day, why he always does.\n\nAt least, well, that's what I think anyway...' \n\nSome of the company of travellers started to mutter and murmur, creating a jumble of opinions, but quickly simmered down when Galanthea began to speak. 'A curious insight.' She paused to think, tapping her fingers against her goblet. 'I agree. Childhoods play a big part in shaping our lives, but I don't think knightly virtues alone compel Alzur. No, I believe something much more powerful is at work. The most powerful thing in the known world, in fact...'\n\n'Aye, an' what'd that be, then?' asked the dwarf.\n\n'Love.'
journey_3_story_4;'Love!?' shrieked the merchant. 'That's a cartload of horseshite! Love!? This was the man who slaughtered half of Ellander's army, just because he could!'\n\n'Aye, I say "love" for good reason,' reassured Galanthea. 'I say "love" because of something I discovered the second time I met Alzur—the second time he saved me, as it happens. Two for two,' she chuckled. 'In an unfortunate twist of fate, I found myself... somewhat cursed. Oh, yes! Afflicted by a hex that, ever-so-strangely, converged on my skills as a balladeer.'\n\nThe halfling gasped. 'So that's why you hung up your fiddle!'\n\n'No, no. Quite the contrary, the curse turned my middling melodies into enchanting chansons. Catch was⁠—singing was all I could do,' she grinned. 'I'd open my mouth to speak, only to have an unruly rush of rhythm and rhyme.'\n\nSome of the travellers chortled with amusement, sure that Galanthea was merely spinning a merry tale.\n\n'It was quite whimsical at first; a comical oddity. And the remuneration for my performances was nothing to scoff at, either. Alas, coin aside, it quickly became quite the burden. Perpetual song, day in, day out. If I wished to utter but a measly word, nothing could stop me from spewing forth a stanza of verses to accompany it. Finally, I resolved myself to seek assistance. Primarily due to a rather mortifying experience. You see, I was attending a funeral and made the poor choice to inquire as to where I could…' a blush crept up her cheeks, 'relieve myself… To this day, I dare not return, for fear of reliving the embarrassment.' She shuddered from the thought. 'Months passed, with not a shred of luck finding aid. Then... destiny⁠—being the sly mistress she is⁠—decided to intervene once more, and I soon found myself staying in the same countryside inn as a certain mage…\n\n'I pleaded my case to Alzur, sure he would once again jump in to assist. But he refused. Told me he had far more important matters to attend to; "let some other poor wretch waste his time on curious cases of delusion". But, I stuck around. You see, he wasn't yet aware of my unyielding persistence. So, I enlightened him... with three whole days of song. Every ballad, lullaby, poem, and solemn chant I could dream up. He tried his magic to silence me, of course, but it was futile⁠—the curse was unrelenting. Finally, he crumbled, beseeching me to stop; agreed to investigate the matter if only I'd vow to keep my mouth shut.'\n\n'What's all this got to do with love?' demanded the soldier.\n\n'Well, we were travelling to the town where I was first afflicted, staying at inns along the way. One night, Alzur was up late with the local lads, drinking and playing dice and...  see, I was awfully nosy back then—as young 'uns are—and I decided to rummage through his belongings. Found all sorts of strange and wonderful trinkets but, being a lass, I was drawn to a particular item: a medallion shaped like a flower⁠. A lily, as it turned out. And... I tried it on... Just as Alzur strolled in...\n\n'He immediately flew into a rage⁠—shouting and scolding me ever-so-fierce. I was startled and… so confused. It was just a simple bauble, after all, and it wasn't as if I'd marred it,' she smirked, 'the power of sentimentality, it seems, eluded me back then. But he soon calmed; even apologised for his outburst. He settled before the hearth, reeking of liquor, and gazed into the flames, his anger giving way to sadness. Then, something quite surprising happened. He confided in me.\n\n'Told me how he had assembled the medallion many years ago for someone... very dear to him. Imbued it with magic even, to keep her safe. "Lylianna", he whispered. He talked ever-so-fondly about her, mumbling drunken homage to her memory. Expressed his admiration for her ambition. From what I was able to stitch together, she was utterly enthralled with the idea of a safer world; one free from murderous monstrosities lurking behind every shadow. A grand vision, to be sure. And she worked towards this her entire life which, sadly, proved rather brief⁠—for a sorceress at least.\n\n'He didn't mention how she died, just fell silent for a time and brooded in a drunken stupor, his eyes full of sorrow.' Galanthea paused, reminiscing. 'He never used the word "love", but the way he spoke of her, the look upon his face when recalling her memory... it couldn't have been anything else.'\n\n'I suppose that makes sense,' admitted the halfling. 'Hold on... did⁠—did he take up her work? After she died? He did, didn't he?!' \n\n'Indeed, I believe so. An obligation to the departed can be dreadfully hard to sever.'\n\n'Aye!' The dwarf leapt up, turning to face the merchant. 'And that's yet another reason why he saves people from monsters! Does that satisfy your inquisition, milord? Ha!'\n\nThe merchant shook off the blatant affront. 'Well⁠—well how the devils did he continue her "work", anyhow? One man prancing around the continent slaying beasties in the name of his delusional lost love could hardly put a dent in their numbers, now, could it?'\n\n'One man? Goodness no,' Galanthea answered with a devilish smile, 'not one man at all...'
journey_3_story_5;'...Witchers!' exclaimed the soldier, 'she's talking about witchers!'\n\n'What was that now?' questioned the merchant, casually pouring himself another drink from a sheepskin flask.\n\n'Witchers. At least, that's what I've 'eard 'em called.' The soldier scratched his bristly chin. 'Think, like... a mercenary, only they's magically enhanced. Ruddy strong 'n fast, more so than any man. Been goin' round, they 'ave, loners on the road, so I hear, pledgin' to kill monsters for coin.'\n\n'Sounds like gibberish to me.'\n\n'Yeah? And what the 'ell would you know?'\n\n'You said "mercenaries", correct? Well, I happen to know a fella who should be able to provide some insight on that.' He gestured to the cloaked man sitting in the shadows. 'A mercenary himself, as it happens. Well, more of a back alley cut-throat, really. Isn't that right, Cut-Throat?'\n\nThe cloaked man spat in response, spurring the merchant to guffaw.\n\n'Not the most courteous of gentlemen, I'll admit, but a solid reputation for killing⁠—seen so first-hand, as it happens. Of course, I was on the lookout for a suitable chaperone, so pledged to toss a few coins his way should he see me to Maribor safely. Quite the bargain, weren't you?' A pause lingered. 'But I digress. Cut-Throat! As an expert on the matter of sword-wielding hirelings, what do you think about these "exceptional monster slayers"?'\n\nThe cloaked man tilted his head and pondered for a moment. 'A man kills a beast… so what? Nothing exceptional about it. Just bedtime tales.'\n\n'And there we have it!' declared the merchant, a smarmy grin plastered across his face. '"Bedtime tales!"'\n\n'Nay, nay! Not true. These stories I've 'eard from reliable men. From all over 'n all, they are, sayin' the exact same thing. How could they all 'appen upon the same lie? Tell me that!'\n\n'Deceptions spread fast, my friend. Offtimes faster than the truth.'\n\nThe soldier shook his head. 'Nay, nay⁠⁠—'\n\n'Listen, I'm not saying these chums of yours haven't seen brave men put down a beast here and there⁠—I won't deny anyone's fighting prowess. But "magically modified soldiers" is complete and utter balderdash, you must admit. And even⁠—even if⁠—' The merchant sprang off his stump, seized a stone, and flung it at a couple of rats skulking near the perimeter.\n\nThe rodents hissed and chattered as they scurried away into the underbrush.\n\n'Now, where was I? Ah, yes: even if these, these "witch men"—'\n\n'—Witchers, I just ruddy well said!'\n\nThe merchant flapped his arms. 'Yes, yes! "Witchers!" Even if they do exist, as you and your pals say, what need have we of them, really? Are the monsters that much of a threat? Sure, I'll admit, they kill off a few unfortunate sods here and there, but it's only the senseless really, isn't it? Those ignorant fools that stray too far from the beaten path; get themselves eaten in some dank swamp in the middle of nowhere.'\n\n'That's feckin' preposterous, that is. A mockery!' bawled the dwarf.\n\n'Quite apt, actually! You haven't got the coin to afford safe passage? Then you bloody well stay put, where it's safe. Too poor or frugal to invest in a good escort like myself? Then perhaps you shouldn't go galavanting across the countryside in the first place. Besides, the monsters probably do us all a favour, when you think about it... get rid of the dregs of society, if you will. Cull the herd.'\n\nThe soldier ground his teeth, suppressing his rage. 'And what makes you so special?'\n\n'Have you not been paying attention? Or perhaps hard of hearing?' He nodded towards Cut-Throat, who was now strolling around the edge of the camp. 'Like I said, I've an astute sense of self-preservation, and thus, am amply prepared for anything.'\n\n'Best prepare ye self for a good slap, ye keep yappin' away with that trap o' yours,' the dwarf snapped.\n\n'—Quiet!' Cut-Throat hushed. He was now standing deadly-still, head tilted toward the darkness beyond the campfire's glow, fixated on something. 'Keep it down. It's too late in the night for a ruckus.' Hand on the pommel of his sword, he stalked away from the camp.\n\n'Excuse me,' the merchant persisted. 'Where do you imagine you're going? Cut-Throat!?' Cut-Throat, unabated, disappeared into the inky wilderness without another word.\n\n'He's right,' Galanthea said, 'it's rather late, and my old bones need their rest.' She climbed to her feet and made her way towards her tent. 'We have a long day on the morrow.'\n\n'Aye, aye,' mumbled the dwarf, draining the last of his mead. 'Aye, we've that indeed.'\n\nWithin the hour, the entire party had turned in and were sound asleep, even the designated lookout…\n\n... While somewhere nearby, amid the shadows, two beady red eyes glinted in the pale moonlight.
journey_3_story_6;Guttural snores resounded through the campsite, along with the soft crackling of the fading flames. High above, the light of a full moon peeked through looming clouds, painting everything outside of the embers' glow in an eerie monochrome.\n\nOne of the tents rippled. The merchant stumbled out of the front flaps, dazed by drowsiness. He eyed the silhouette of a large tree at the perimeter, and worked his way towards it, weaving between sleeping travellers snuggled up to the fire.\n\nFinding a secluded spot in the shadows, he unfastened his breeches and relieved himself—\n\nSQUEAK!\n\nThe merchant lurched, sloshing urine over his feet as he pivoted towards the sound. 'Curse it!'\n\nA rat perched on a nearby stump, glaring at the merchant. It chattered, mimicking laughter.\n\n'You little shit!' he shrilled, picking up a fistful of stones and flinging them at the rodent. 'Shoo!'\n\nThe rat, unfazed by the bombardment, remained where it was, chirping defiantly.\n\n'Right!' declared the merchant, surveying his surroundings, 'I'll bloody well show you, you vile—ah, there we are!' He picked up a large rock and lugged it towards the creature. 'Don't. Say. I. Didn't. Warn⁠—HUAH!' He hurled the heavy stone, and the rodent jumped away, retreating into a nearby bush.\n\n'Ha!' he proclaimed with a conceited grin. 'And let that be a lesson⁠⁠⁠—'\n\nSQUEAK, SQUEAK!\n\nThe merchant jumped, twirling around. A mischief of rats stood behind him.\n\n'Where in good graces did⁠—'\n\nSQUEAK! SQUEAK! SQUEAK!\n\nMore rats scurried from the underbrush, encircling him.\n\n'W-w-what the…' he croaked.\n\nThey glared at him; a sea of tiny eyes twinkling in the moonlight.\n\n'Cut-throat?' he whispered. ‘Cut-throat...w-w-where a-are…'\n\nA shadow slowly enveloped the area, blotting out the moonlight as it rose above the merchant. Trembling, he turned⁠—’Cut-Throat?’—to face two scarlet eyes peering down from high above, a frothing maw, and elongated incisors dripping with putrid saliva.\n\nThe merchant let out a terrified wail, just as his throat was ripped open.\n\nAn army of rats scampered through the campsite as travellers spilt from their tents and sleeping nooks, yelling and jeering amid the chaos.\n\nSomeone screamed as the dismembered torso of the merchant hurtled through the air and landed in the centre of camp. Then a bristly behemoth appeared from the shadows; an intimidating physique of exposed muscle and scarred flesh. It bellowed, chattering its oversized maw, and swiped a charging dwarf, effortlessly launching him across the site and into the darkness beyond.\n\nThe giant rodent's eyes darted around and fell upon Galanthea, who was emerging from her tent in a state of confusion. It gnashed its teeth, then lumbered towards her, snarling and slobbering.\n\nTHWACK!\n\nA crossbow bolt embedded itself into the monster's shoulder. It shrieked and tore out the wooden shaft, snapping its jaws viciously as it scoured for the source.\n\nTHUD!\n\nAnother bolt, into the thorax this time.\n\n'Get back!' Cut-Throat dashed out of the thicket, dropped the crossbow, and unsheathed his sword. The blade shimmered with a silvery luminescence as he twirled it around.\n\nThe beast roared, then rushed at him. Cut-Throat lifted his sword and braced himself, waiting until the last possible moment... he pirouetted to the left and slashed the monster's broad back with a wide stroke, sending a mist of crimson across the camp.\n\nA mesmerising flurry of slices, feigns, and ripostes followed, accompanied by blood spatter and piercing yowls as the cloaked man confidently commanded the flow of the fight, cutting with inconceivable speed and expert precision.\n\nSuccumbing to the lacerations, the rodent abomination let out a whine, stumbled to its knees, and slanted forwards, red seeping into the dirt around its mighty frame.\n\nThe man angled his blade, ready to administer the final blow.\n\nOne of the bystanders gasped as the monster's arm shot out, seizing its opponent by the throat. The beast snarled and climbed to its feet, lifting the man high above the ground. The wounds on its disfigured body closed back up⁠—severed flesh and slashed muscle knitting themselves back together. The sword slipped from the man's fingers as he reached up, clasping at the furry mitts throttling him.\n\nSpectators stood frozen, gawping as Cut-Throat flailed in the beast's grasp. Then, in a moment that amazed all present, he extended his hand towards the rodent's gnarly face and made a peculiar gesture with his fingers.\n\nFlames surged from his palm, blasting the monstrosity with an inferno; melting its face and sternum. It howled violently, clawing at its snout as it released the man and stumbled backwards.\n\nIn a flash, Cut-Throat pulled out a leathery orb with a fuse, ignited it with a snap of his fingers, and tossed it at the feet of the caterwauling behemoth.\n\nThe bomb fizzed and sparked...\n\nBAROOM!\n\nThe wererat exploded into chunks of charred flesh and bone.\n\nThe remaining travellers, drenched in blood and innards, stood in awe.\n\nCut-Throat sauntered over to the mangled corpse of the merchant, rummaged through his satchel, and retrieved a small jingling pouch. He cast his gaze over the onlookers' gawking faces, shrugged, then pocketed the coin.\n\nMouth agape, the soldier stuttered, pointing a shaky finger at the cloaked man, then uttered a single word of disbelief. '... Witcher.'
journey_3_story_7;The sun glared down on the travelling caravan ambling along the dusty road to Maribor. Towards the rear of the convoy, Galanthea sat in the back of a wagon, watching the witcher intently as he slowly approached her on horseback.\n\nShe greeted him with a welcoming smile. 'You have my utmost gratitude for your services last night.'\n\nHe furrowed his brow, resentful of the compliment, but reluctantly accepted and gave her a cursory nod.\n\nGalanthea chuckled to herself as a thought crossed her mind. 'I guess, by extension, Alzur saved me yet again.'\n\nThe witcher clenched his jaw; his nostrils flaring.\n\n'Something the matter, my dear?' she asked, 'I'd wager you didn't just trot over here to bask in my appreciation.'\n\nHe paused, taking a moment to compose his thoughts. 'Did you even know Alzur?'\n\n'Oh... I knew him better than most.'\n\n'Then why spew shit you know ain't true?' He cracked his neck. 'Maybe you're just delusional. Or utterly blind.'\n\nShe smiled. 'Truths aren't necessarily universal, my boy. Sometimes they're just a matter of perspective.'\n\nThe witcher grumbled, rode in silence for a while, then shook his head with frustration. '"Love"...?' he rebuked. 'If he actually cared for others, he would never have done what he did. What he no doubt still does.'\n\n'You have something you'd like to say.' Galanthea eyed the man, then stifled a yawn. 'Sleep eluded me last night⁠—as you can imagine—so hop to it, lad... while I'm still cognizant.'\n\n'Do you even have an inkling of how Alzur and his lackeys make witchers?'\n\n'Not with love, I deduce...'\n\n'They take little boys. Nab 'em from the streets. Pay off parents, if they have to. Do whatever they can to get their hands on fresh subjects. You see, it has to be children⁠—that's what they told us. Cosimo, the older mage⁠—white-bearded bastard⁠, he was—used to always rattle off some bullshit about... malleability. He and Alzur would refer to us as slabs of wet clay, primed for moulding. So fuckin' detached. Once you've lived so many years, they'd say, life takes its toll, and the clay, well, it sets. Hardens. Tryin' to reshape a grown man becomes impossible because they just splinter and snap. So, kids are the only ones that can be subjected to the mutations⁠—at least, they're the only ones that stand any sort of chance. Even then, most break anyway.' The witcher stared at Galanthea, assessing her reaction. 'Many of the boys I knew now sleep in shallow graves.'\n\nShe avoided his gaze and instead surveyed the pastures aside the road.\n\n'Yeah... dead children don't make the best ballad material, do they?'\n\nTurning back to the witcher, she remained silent, her eyes welling with curiosity.\n\n'We had to bury them ourselves; with their mangled bodies and twisted faces—mouths still agape from their final screams. Thing is, they were the lucky ones. Got out quick. The rest of us poor sods had to go on and endure Alzur's various "Trials"—or so he called them, as if they were heroic feats we had chosen to undertake, to prove our worth. As if we made a choice to go through hell for that cunt's validation.'\n\n'You say he does it all for some vision of a better world. I say fuck that⁠—he does it all for himself. Vainglory. Helpin' others is just... overspill. Sure, he'd feign compassion from time to time, when eyes were on him. Like when the fools who funded his sordid little projects came to visit. Oh, he'd put on quite a show for the aristocrats. Real hospitable he'd get⁠ while parading us around. Flaunting his success. His brilliance. "Behold what the Great Alzur hath conjured for you, gentlemen''. Arrogant fuck.' He snorted. 'Then, content with their investment, they'd leave, and he'd snap right back to cold indifference. Return to his tower. Wouldn't see him again until the next trial was ready, and those weren't exactly happy occasions for us. Nah... we were just a means to an end for that bastard⁠—a way to establish his reputation. Ensure his legacy.' His eyes glazed over as he pondered. '... Just wet clay in the hand, ready to be shaped to his will.'\n\nA moment lingered.\n\n'You tell quite the tale, witcher.' Galanthea smirked softly. 'Ever considered a profession in storytelling?'\n\n'Jest if you must, but it's the damn truth⁠—fuck perspective.' He hawked and spat into the dirt, then returned to brooding in memory.\n\nHer eyes lingered on the witcher as he ambled alongside the wagon, steeped in thought.\n\n'You know...' She paused, considering her words carefully. 'I'm genuinely grateful you were with us last night. I wish you to know that.'\n\nThe witcher hesitated, then nodded. 'I should go on ahead⁠... make sure no surprises await us down the trail.' He blinked away a memory, then grasped the reins of his horse⁠—' Enjoy your rest'—and galloped away.
journey_3_story_8;Galanthea reclined in the back of the wagon, relaxing as she gazed up at the cloudless sky. She blinked slowly, her lids heavy and sluggish as she listened to the rhythmic trot of the horses upfront...\n\n... High above, a flock of birds circled amid the vast azure. One of them let out a hellish shriek. She squinted and realised they weren't birds at all. Wide, ragged wings flapped sporadically, and long scaly tails flicked behind them. The flying terrors swooped lower, descending on the caravan. One yowled as it exploded into a ball of gore. Then another, and another. A torrent of blood and guts rained down.\n\nAlzur's voice reverberated all around. 'Fear not, little one. You're safe.'\n\nThe crimson downpour lapsed to clear water as it thrashed against the outside of a town hall; a warm glow radiating from its windows. \n\nInside, emaciated bodies coughed and wheezed as they huddled together in groups of men, women, and children, shaking and whimpering. A figure in a black waxed overcoat and beaked mask weaved through the bodies, prodding them inquisitively with his cane.\n\nOn a makeshift stage of crates, a young Galanthea, donning boyish troubadour attire, played a fiddle and sang a cheery song for her sickly audience. Their sunken eyes gleamed with contorted joy as they smiled through their agony.\n\nA croaky, brittle voice cut through the scene. 'Oh, dear, sweet, poor thing. The sickness, 'tis in you. Deep hath it burrowed.'\n\nGalanthea stopped playing and lowered her instrument, her eyes widening. A congregation of corpses sat before her, their naked bodies withered and rotten. Each wore a beaked mask. One by one, they began to caw, growing louder and louder. A symphony of hoarse coos consumed the soundscape.\n\nThe candles extinguished, plunging the room into pitch black and eerie silence.\n\n'Death looms, and your light fades.' Two eyes shone amid the dark. 'But fret not, my child, for Old Thelma can cure thy rot.'\n\nFlames from a central hearth blazed up, illuminating the inside of a small cottage. An assortment of trinkets and baubles piled up high around the room, and crows adorned the shelves and rafters, cawing as they hopped about.\n\nYoung Galanthea, skinny and pale, sat in front of the fire, staring at the old lady draped in black feathers on the other side of the flames.\n\n'An oath shalt thou take, thy song thou shalt give,' she flashed her teeth at the young bard, 'and Old Thelma will ensure thou go on⁠—that thou shalt live.' She sniggered.\n\nThe flames of the hearth flared and swelled, spilling across the timber flooring and crawling up the walls; consuming everything.\n\nIn the middle of a secluded grove, a cottage burned violently. A harrowing scream pierced through the roaring inferno. 'Child! What hast thou done!?'\n\nGalanthea stood in the grove, watching the fiery destruction through wet eyes. \n\nAlzur's voice echoed all around. 'Just nod, Snowdrop, and consider it done.'\n\nA hand squeezed her shoulder. She turned to see Alzur standing next to her, his face and chest spattered with blood. He knelt before her, and a malevolent grin crept across his face. 'Two for two.' He chuckled.\n\nFire devoured the grove.\n\nThe hideous wailing crescendoed⁠—\n\nGalanthea's eyes snapped open, and she sat upright, her skin slick with sweat.\n\nCatching her breath, she surveyed her surroundings and noticed the wagon had stopped.\n\nSounds of an argument came from nearby. A shrill voice shouted, 'We ain't messin' around, ye hear? Step⁠— step the fuck back!'\n\nShe hopped off the back of the wagon and saw they were pulled up next to an inn alongside a crossroad. A wooden sign read: "The Double-Cross".\n\nGalanthea rounded the wagon's rear to see the caravan encircled by a mismatched band of men and women in peasant garb, armed with rusty swords, scythes, and pitchforks. In the middle, a lanky woman brandished a crossbow with a tense, shaky grasp and pointed it at the soldier.\n\nThe soldier took a step towards her. 'C'mon, don't be daft.' He took another step, a tad too aggressively. 'You don't have to⁠—'\n\nTWANG.\n\nA bolt sprang forth, striking the soldier in his knee. He grunted and clasped at the shaft, then toppled to the ground. 'Ploughin' bitch!'\n\n'I-I-I fuckin' warned you, I did,' she stuttered, then flicked her eyes around the onlookers. 'None of ye fuck about, alright? Or⁠... or see what ye get!' she exclaimed nervously as she hastily fumbled another bolt into the groove. 'Anyone take issue with that?'\n\nNone of the travellers responded.\n\n'Good!' The woman nodded to one of her men. 'Get 'em inside, outta the way.'
journey_3_story_9;'Just our fuckin' luck, this is,' the dwarf glowered as he lit another candle, placing it on one of the kegs in the corner of the cellar.\n\n'Please do be careful⁠—with the flames,' the halfling cautioned. 'Lest we hop out of the frying pan and into, well, you know...'\n\n'Ach, dinnae worry. Got hands as steady as stone.' He lit another and positioned it on a shelf. 'How long ye been down here, laddie?' he asked the innkeeper, who was perched on a barrel.\n\n'Oh... not too long. A few days, perhaps.' The innkeeper panned over the company of travellers. 'You're the first they've…'\n\n'Robbed?' the dwarf cut in.\n\n'Yeah. Sorry. Don't take it personally. They aren't brigands⁠—not really. I even know most of 'em. Local farmers and helpin' hands mainly. But... with this accursed drought lingerin' as long as it has, folks have got desperate—real hopeless. So, they're… improvising.'\n\nThe soldier let out a moan as Galanthea tightened rags around his bloodied knee.\n\nDust fell from the ceiling as stifled footsteps trampled the floorboards above their heads, along with muffled voices.\n\n'I'm sorry about your friend. I'm sure they didn't mean it.'\n\n'Dinnae worry; he'll be fine. Won't ye?'\n\nThe soldier grumbled.\n\n'But nae more soldiering for you, eh?' he chuckled. 'Best get used to guard duty. Heh!' He grinned as he lit an oil lamp, illuminating a large painting resting against the back wall. The huge canvas depicted an immense battlefield. One side raised white and black standards in triumphant celebration, while the other army cowered beneath a torrent of raining fire descending from the sky. Amid the victors, an illustrious-looking mage stood proud with his arms raised, surrounded by luminous runes.\n\n'The final battle of The Endless War,' the innkeeper informed them. '"Alzur's Double-Cross"… the painting's called. We get⁠— well, we used to get many folks from Ellander passing through, and it seemed in bad taste, so we popped it down here, out of the way.' He chuckled. 'Can't do much about the name of the inn though.'\n\n'So it's true then?' the halfling probed. 'Alzur used his magic to slay an army?'\n\nThe dwarf held the lamp's glow up to the painting. 'Aye. Looks that way.'\n\nMore dust fell from the ceiling as people moved about above. The indistinct voices increased in volume.\n\n'You've heard of him then? Alzur?' the innkeeper asked.\n\n'Some tales here 'n there, aye.' The dwarf scanned over the burning army, its soldiers fleeing and screaming as they perished. 'They didnae stand a chance.'\n\nThe innkeeper rose from the barrel and strolled over to the painting. 'The artwork doesn't show it, but it's said he opened a portal. Used a spell⁠ to summon something dreadfully powerful from, well...  another world, I suppose⁠. People talk about how the sky split apart, and a storm of swirling fire swept across the battlefield. But it weren't no dragon or anythin' like that. No... somethin' much worse...' He stroked his moustache. 'Laid waste to their army, whatever it was—a crushin' defeat. And Ellander, well, they had no choice but to surrender outright; gave up the throne of Vizima to the Duke of Maribor the very next day. Finally puttin' an end to The Endless War.'\n\n'Ain't right,' scorned the dwarf, gawping at the canvas. 'It's a swindle. Battles should be fought with honour, on equal footin'. None o' this… otherworldly shite. Those men shouldnae died in such a way.'\n\n'Yes. Quite right, I have to agree,' the halfling added.\n\n'He did it...' Galanthea looked up from the soldier, her eyes sombre. '... to save lives.'\n\nThe dwarf guffawed. 'Aye, lass, aye! And I fuck for chastity!'\n\n'No, no, she's quite right,' the innkeeper corrected. 'The war was some nasty business indeed. Endless bloodshed raged across these parts, for generations, all so one Duke or another could sit upon a slightly bigger throne.'\n\n'Aye, I've heard about the skirmishes, but... why'd it last so long?' the dwarf asked.\n\n'Well,' the innkeeper sat back on the barrel, 'both forces were equal in strength, so they found themselves at a constant stalemate, no side winning more than its fair share of battles. And with that balance came the hope of eventual victory, I guess, for both sides, so neither Duke would back down… nor their sons... or their sons' sons. They just... kept on sending their men to slaughter, time and again... for duty, or honour, or pride⁠—or whatever other lie the nobles tell their pawns to justify the sacrifice. And "sacrifice" is puttin' it lightly. Around these parts, you'd be hard-pressed to find a family who didn't lose several ancestors to that blasted war.'\n\nThe dwarf shook his head solemnly.\n\n'Without Alzur's intervention,' the innkeeper concluded, 'there's no sayin' how long the bloodshed would have continued...'\n\nThe dwarf furrowed his brow. 'Aye... But it cannae be right, can it? To do such a thing... He shouldnae meddle in the fates of others...'\n\n'Meddling in the fates of others…' Galanthea smiled, '... is what he does best.'\n\nA shrill scream rang out from upstairs.\n\nTHUD!

mon_fluff_description;Humans like to think they are the masters of the Continent. Yet it's enough to stray from the beaten path, or perk one's ears when the moon waxes full, to understand the folly of such arrogance. In dense forests, shadowy ravines, and the damp, musty cellars of abandoned homes, countless eyes glow bright and sharp fangs drip wet... A monstrous swarm will await the opportune moment to emerge and feed. Frenzied with bloodlust, they strike with reckless abandon. Fortunately, such uncoordinated attacks can sometimes be fended off. Yet when one takes command of the beasts and gives them purpose, well... No wall, nor shield, nor metal plate upon your breast will prove enough. Human blood will flow and screams of terror shall pierce the night.

nilf_fluff_description;Left, right, left, right... All of the Continent shakes under the disciplined march of Nilfgaard's heavy infantry. And in their wake follow fire-heaving siege machines, silver-tongued emissaries, cutthroat assassins wielding toxin-laced, serpentine daggers... From behind barred doors and shuttered windows, the people of the North watch with horror, quietly muttering their desperate pleas to Melitele... "Good Mother, deliver us from evil most foul. Spare from ruin our harvests, and from chains our babes..." Yet, if the pillars of smoke billowing along the Pontar and the Yaruga are any indication, it seems their prayers fall on deaf ears.

nor_fluff_description;In no royal court nor library will one ever find an accurate map of the Northern Realms. For whenever a cartographer has drawn his last border, one of the land's many kings, princes, or margraves has already invaded his neighbor, once again altering the political fabric of the North. Disputes and rivalries rage on without end – Aedirn and Kaedwen, Temeria and Lyria... Yet, in this cycle of madness, the Nordlings emerge as seasoned warriors, resilient folk accustomed to both strife and sacrifice. They are a difficult people to break – especially when the time comes for them to set aside their petty differences and stand united against a common foe. Alas, the air of shared victory does not linger long before they once again leap at each other's throats...

reward_tree_adda_chest_1;Upon discovering Adda had been transformed into a striga, King Foltest immediately promised a weighty reward to any who could disenchant the princess... And a swift retribution to any who dared slay her. A long while passed before someone stepped up to the task. The volunteer turned out to be none other than Geralt of Rivia, a witcher from the School of the Wolf.
reward_tree_adda_chest_2;After Geralt lifted the curse, it seemed Adda had become an ordinary girl. Pleasant, eloquent, undeniably beautiful – she quickly became the pride and joy of the Temerian court. However, dark rumors began to circulate among the royal family's servants. In her bedchamber, away from prying eyes, Adda had committed horrible atrocities against her maidservants... Though, details remain unknown as many were never to be seen again.
reward_tree_adda_chest_3;A telling sign that Adda's curse had not been fully undone was her love for catoblepas flesh. The meat of a catoblepas – known also as a gorgon – has a very peculiar taste, disturbingly similar to that of human flesh. Considering the beasts are scarce and their meat a rare delicacy at banquets in the Temerian court, Princess Adda was forced to settle for a more readily available substitute.
reward_tree_adda_story_pt1;A beautiful young girl with a button nose and a storm of red hair – what's there to fear? Well, appearances can be deceiving... And in Adda's case, more so than usual.
reward_tree_adda_story_pt2;It appeared the witcher had, indeed, cured the ghastly affliction that gave Adda the rather nasty habit of turning into a striga. But if you believe the rumors, the princess has been known to relapse.
reward_tree_adda_story_pt3;At first, it was thought Adda had been cursed by the gods, for she was the product of an incestuous affair between King Foltest and his sister, Adda of Temeria. The truth, as is often the case, was revealed to be quite different...
reward_tree_adda_story_pt4;The witcher's investigation showed that a romantically-frustrated courtier by name of Ostrit was responsible for Adda's curse. Unsurprisingly, it seemed the gods had played no role, proving yet again to be indifferent toward the foul deeds of man... Fortunately, one does not require divine power to rout out wickedness.
reward_tree_adda_title;Princess Adda
reward_tree_anna_chest_1;Anna Henrietta never felt the weight of a sword in her hand, pondered the memoirs of great rulers, nor cared enough to deeply study the Continent's rich history. Yet these apparent faults have done little to diminish her duchy's successes in matters of war. Her secret? Knight-errants from across the Continent – drawn by word of Anna's beauty and charm – are willing to sacrifice anything to earn the duchess's favor. From a safe distance, in the company of her maidservants, Anna Henrietta fans herself as the chivalrous knights' declare their vows—casting them beguiling looks as they gallop off toward their doom.
reward_tree_anna_chest_2;When it comes to grace and couture, none go to greater lengths than the duchess herself. Gods forbid she be caught wearing the same gown twice, and woe betide any soul who spies Her Grace before her frizzy curls have been tamed into a perfectly symmetrical coiffure. However, should circumstances demand it, Anarietta would not hesistate to tear off her frilly skirt to mount the nearest steed and rush headlong into another adventure.
reward_tree_anna_chest_3;Despite Toussaint's status as a vassal state within the mighty Nilfgaardian Empire, Anna Henrietta never faced a significant conflict within its borders. It should come as no great surprise then that Beauclair's guardsmen are better trained for parades and fanfare than mortal combat. Thus, when vampires and other bloodthirsty beasts emerged to feast from the caverns deep beneath the duchy's capital, the city's only hope rushed to meet them with dull blades and frilled caftans—only to be decimated. Yet for those who survived, nothing could have better prepared them for the true horrors of war.
reward_tree_anna_story_pt1;Duchess Anna Henrietta is widely revered for her many favorable qualities—in particular, her generosity, kindheartedness and sensitivity to the plight of Toussaint's commoners. If only she had but a touch more patience and perspective—why, she would have all the makings of a truly prodigious sovereign!
reward_tree_anna_story_pt2;The famed bard Dandelion who, for a time, became intimately entwined with Anna Henrietta, drew creative inspiration from his passionate affair with the duchess: "Across the world most fickle I've found, a mountain's weather and a little weasel crowned."
reward_tree_anna_story_pt3;Though perhaps not the wittiest words penned by the illustrious poet, they bring light to a very real problem. Anna Henrietta was prone to sudden changes of opinion without provocation—a reality that oft caused the already powdered faces of the duchess's court to turn a shade paler.
reward_tree_anna_story_pt4;For, when the duchess fell into a gracious mood, she doled out great riches and noble titles like chocolate soufflés at a royal banquet. Yet, should anything disrupt her fragile equilibrium, heads rolled down Beauclair's cobbled streets and crimson blood pooled on the palace's marbled floors.
reward_tree_anna_title;Anna Henrietta
reward_tree_arachas_chest_1;Once native to the far south, this invasive species migrated north over the course of decades, adjusting as it went to new climates and temperatures. It finds damp woodlands and swamps most hospitable and made them its home, making use of the mulch and moss found there as cover during its winter hibernation. Arachasae often hide their unprotected, sac-like abdomens under a hollow tree-trunk shell worn on their back... Unfortunately, as a result, overlooking them is a far too common – and lethal –mistake.
reward_tree_arachas_chest_2;At first glance, a stationary arachas often looks like a part of the forest undergrowth, a fact it uses to deadly advantage when hunting. It usually begins a battle by spitting venom, then tries to grab its prey with prehensile feelers in order to drag it within reach of its crushing pincers. The best defense against its tactics, you ask? There isn't one.
reward_tree_arachas_chest_3;According to scholars at Oxenfurt, the hive queens of most insect and insectoid species are almost completely defenseless. Arachasae, however, are a notable exception. An arachas queen is the largest and strongest in her swarm. A single drop of her venom is enough to bring down an adult man, a swipe of their claws can cleave through a Nilfgaardian pavise as if through butter. When two arachasae swarms vie for territory and the queens battle for supremacy, all other woodland creatures flee the forest with haste, as if escaping a raging wildfire...
reward_tree_arachas_story_pt1;“N’aracche aen woed endicen."\n– Elven proverb\n"Let sleeping arachasae lie." Sage advice... For where there's one, the queen is likely not far off.
reward_tree_arachas_story_pt2;And woe shall befall any who strays across her path. Many monsters can be deceived, enticed, or by fire and silver scared off... Yet, an arachas queen is no ordinary monster.
reward_tree_arachas_story_pt3;She is driven by raw, primal instinct. Kill, eat, breed, kill, eat, breed... In a single week, a queen can lay over one thousand eggs. If not destroyed in time, you'd be advised to find a new home. And quickly.
reward_tree_arachas_story_pt4;The swarm's allegiance to its queen is absolute. Bewitched by her pheromones, the drones will do anything to serve their matriarch – rush into a blaze, dive into a chasm, sacrifice their bodies in her defense. Human commanders can only dream of such unconditional loyalty.
reward_tree_arachas_title;Arachas Queen
reward_tree_ardal_chest_1;Ardal aep Dahy played an important role in aiding Emhyr's seizure of the throne from the Usurper. He had hoped the young, inexperienced emperor—beholden to a debt of gratitude—would serve as loyal puppet. Yet once it became obvious that Emhyr would never bend to aep Dahy's will, he immediately began plotting a conspiracy for his overthrow – all while maintaining an unwavering ritual of fawning compliments and dutiful smiles.
reward_tree_ardal_chest_2;When preparations for the Second Northern War were underway, aep Dahy was initially assigned to lead Army Group "West". However, this did little to please the duke, for in fact he wasn't at all eager to prove his strength against the likes of Foltest and Vizimir. Instead, he pulled a few strings to be sent to the eastern front where he'd stand against Demavend and the gods-forsakened backwaters of Lyria and Rivia, ruled by a certain Queen Meve...
reward_tree_ardal_chest_3;At first, the invasion proceeded according to plan. The Nilfgaardian legions under aep Dahy's command swiftly overpowered Lyria and Rivia without spilling a drop of blood, due in large part to an act of northern treachery. The Aedirnians were consequently caught off guard by Nilfgaard's blitz offensive and, having failed to establish their defenses, capitulated within a fortnight. Looking out over the burning fields and villages from the ramparts of Aldersberg, Ardal aep Dahy smiled with pride. He had every confidence that this very fortress would forever bear the legacy of his triumph.
reward_tree_ardal_story_pt1;To call the Nilfgaardian imperial court a nest of vipers would be, quite frankly, an understatement. Simply in order to keep one's head, one must display exceptional measures of ruthlessness and cunning. To become Emhyr's right hand...  Well now, that would require relinquishing any remaining dregs of conscience.
reward_tree_ardal_story_pt2;Ardal aep Dahy fulfilled all the qualifications. He diligently analyzed everything from courtly intrigues to the war against the Nordlings as if it all were a game of chess. The idea that any given pawn might be a real, human life was never worthy of even an afterthought.
reward_tree_ardal_story_pt3;The blade which hangs from Ardal aep Dahy's waist, with its studded rubies and blunt edge, served a purely ceremonial purpose. Though that did not mean that Ardal was an weak adversary. On the contrary, he simply had others fight his battles for him.
reward_tree_ardal_story_pt4;From the nearest hilltop vantage point, far from the horrific melee of flesh and steel, Ardal aep Dahy commanded his legions via messengers, grimacing in disgust at the bloodcurdling screams of Nordlings crushed and broken beneath Nilfgaardian cavalry.
reward_tree_ardal_title;Ardal aep Dahy
reward_tree_arnjolf_chest_1;Arnjolf numbered among the Disgraced – a band of Skelligan warriors guilty of a crime so vile that the only suitable punishment is exile from the Isles. But one path to regaining their honor remained: death in battle without armor against a worthy foe. And if the misdeed proved especially sinister, he was to be denied his weapon as well. Arnjolf reserved the right to wield his axes – blades he washed in blood at every opportunity.
reward_tree_arnjolf_chest_2;Arnjolf's body was covered with tattoos. The right shoulder bore his criminal sentence as delivered by Clan Brokvar's Council of Elders. The left shoulder bore the name of the father he slew. He marked his back with tallies for the years he'd spent in exile. Finally, upon his brow, a knife-carving of a rune with a simple message for enemy archers: "Aim here."
reward_tree_arnjolf_chest_3;The Disgraced once earned coin as blades-for-hire across the Continent. They seemed the ideal soldiers: modest fees, fought like frenzied bears, and exhibited no fear nor pain. Though, often after a hard-won battle, the Disgraced would suddenly charge at the nearest ally – frustrated at having emerged with their lives yet again. As their reputation spread, only the most desperate invited the Disgraced into their ranks...
reward_tree_arnjolf_story_pt1;Arnjolf's childhood was a happy one: hearthside tales were told by mum, longboats were whittled from logs, and children's games were played... That is, until that fateful day when his estranged father, Ulrik, returned home.
reward_tree_arnjolf_story_pt2;Ulrik had vanished before Arnjolf was born. The Nilfgaardians intercepted his longship, their whole crew put in chains. Six years passed before he managed to escape... Yet by then, the Ulrik of the past was already gone.
reward_tree_arnjolf_story_pt3;Ulrik jumped on any excuse to erupt in a rage, especially if he'd been drinking – and by gods did he drink. His pent-up anger often boiled over onto his wife and children. He beat, and pulled, and slapped with his bare hands. Well, at least that's how it started...
reward_tree_arnjolf_story_pt4;Ulfa, the youngest son, lost his life under his father's axe handle. Agrid, his wife, committed suicide. The night after her funeral, Arnjolf settled his accounts with his father... Later, now branded as one of the Disgraced, he abandoned Skellige's shores.
reward_tree_arnjolf_title;Arnjolf the Patricide
reward_tree_bear_2_story_pt1;It is often said that all the witchers from the Bear School are huge, broad-shouldered and bearded fellows. Ivo of Belhaven, however, did not quite fit this pattern. While he did have a beard, his posture and agility made him more fit to be a Cat or a Viper. Ironically, this made his character perfectly fit to the Bear School…
reward_tree_bear_2_story_pt2;Bears are loners, known for their reluctance towards the company of other witchers, and some might say that Ivo excelled in this field. It already started during his training in Haern Caduch. He did not like other students, to put it mildly. One could even call it hate at first sight. This cost Ivo plenty... Many wounds, much pain, and a lot of lost blood. Bigger sparring partners didn’t show him mercy during training. Yet the fight was always matched and Ivo would pay them back in their own coin.\nBlood for blood.
reward_tree_bear_2_story_pt3;The paths of new Bears parted once their training was over. Later, they would avoid each other as much as possible. Ivo was no different. He didn’t show any interest for the fate of the others, even when the angry mob chased witchers from Haern Caduch. This had nothing to do with anger or animosity, the mutations successfully neutralized such pointless feelings in him Ivo just didn’t care about others.\nThe only thing important was that he would get by.
reward_tree_bear_2_story_pt4;Of course, from time to time, Ivo would run into another witcher.\nOne such occasion was quite memorable. He crossed paths a Bear he knew from the school. The second witcher’s name was Junod, and just like Ivo, he assumed the sobriquet 'of Belhaven'. However, unlike Ivo, he did not come from Belhaven. When asked about the choice, he replied with refreshing candor, that he just liked the sound of the name – and, since he did not expect the smaller Bear to live very long, he did not have any qualms to steal his sobriquet.\nIronically, a couple of years later Ivo heard about Junod's death. And felt…\nNothing, actually.
reward_tree_bear_2_title;Ivo of Belhaven
reward_tree_bear_avatar_chest_1;Vernon Roche never graduated the officers' academy, nor did ever bury his nose in the chronicles of bygone wars. He acquired his experience, rather, by drunken brawls in dark alleys and smokey taverns. Had Foltest never seen something in him and pulled him from the gutter, his fate may have turned out differently altogether.
reward_tree_bear_avatar_chest_2;The Blue Stripes special forces unit was created to pacify the Scoia'tael prescence in Temeria. Its beginnings were difficult as few soldiers were eager to hunt elves in the forest. Rather than accept a slow stream of volunteers, Vernon decided to enlist prisoners – deserters, swindlers, and bandits included. Most perished quickly, pierced by the silent arrows of the Squirrels... Leaving only the most hardiest and craftiest whoresons in his ranks.
reward_tree_bear_avatar_chest_3;Many claim they would do anything for their homeland, but when push comes to shove, these noble pledges often fall short. Vernon Roche proved a stark exception, willing to make any sacrifice for Temeria. Thus, when Nilfgaard occupied the kingdom, he refused to hang up his sword. And even though his squad numbered just a shade over twenty, the Temerian partisans were never extinguished.
reward_tree_bear_avatar_story_pt1;Jaw clenched, eyes narrowed, frayed chaperon atop his head. His name uttered by non-humans to frighten their naughty children. This is Vernon Roche, commander of the Blue Stripes elite special forces unit.
reward_tree_bear_avatar_story_pt2;Considered by some a hero, by others a criminal, though perhaps Thaler put it best. "A bloody patriot and rotten..." Well... You get the idea.
reward_tree_bear_avatar_story_pt3;Roche had the lives of countless enemies on his conscience. Many even who had raised their arms in surrender, no doubt. After all, the Blue Stripes take no prisoners...
reward_tree_bear_avatar_story_pt4;Though Vernon Roche had locked swords with Kaedwenis, Aedirnians, and Redanians, he despised none more than the Scoia'tael... And the feeling was mutual.

reward_tree_bear_border_chest_1;Queen Meve of Lyria and Rivia once encountered a witcher from the School of the Bear. His name was Ivo. His dark complexion suggested he originally hailed from the warm climate of the Continent's southern regions. Whereas, the bluntness with which he responded to the queen's questions suggested he rarely conversed with heads of state...
reward_tree_bear_border_chest_2;A witcher from the School of the Bear once ventured into Toussaint. Junod of Belhaven was his name – as big as a mountain, with a beard that would put a dwarf elder to shame. He accepted a contract to slay a monster that dwelled in the caverns beneath Marcescent Forest. Alas, he was never seen again...
reward_tree_bear_border_chest_3;Just where is the School of the Bear? Some say hidden amidst the Slopes. Others argue it's found farther south, beyond the Amell Mountains. In fact, no one truly knows. And it's no surprise that Bear witchers have kept their whereabouts a secret, for the slaughter of the Wolf and Cat schools was known far and wide...
reward_tree_bear_border_story_pt1;The School of the Bear... Little is known about it, yet one look at their custom armor reveals telling details of the witchers who wear it. A hardy quilted gambeson, heavy mail extending to the knees, plate armor spaulders to protect the shoulders...
reward_tree_bear_border_story_pt2;A witcher equipped in such gear would not leap from raking claws, nor sidestep a beast's gnashing fangs. There is no need, for he can endure the blows... And ensure a short distrance from which he can exact his revenge.
reward_tree_bear_border_story_pt3;Unlike witchers from the Wolf School – who possess strong bonds of friendship and brotherhood – those from the Bear School prefer a solitary lifestyle, away from the company of other witchers. Should they encounter others on the path, however, rarely does it end without bloodshed.
reward_tree_bear_border_story_pt4;Bear witchers often travel to the Skellige Isles – and this should come as no surprise. For the islands have no shortage of monsters and the witchers get along rather well with the similarly brash, bearded locals...
reward_tree_bear_border_title;Season of the Bear
reward_tree_bran_chest_1;Bran's closest advisor and confidant was his wife, Birna. During banquets, she always sat at his side, silent, nearly unnoticeable in the bustle. She could recall every uttered rumor, every knowing wink, every raised eyebrow. Then later, in the bear skin-adorned bed of the royal bedchamber, she would whisper into her husband's ear all that she had learned...
reward_tree_bran_chest_2;Despite Birna's repeated requests, Bran refused to champion their son, Svanrige, as rightful heir to the throne. He believed if the boy truly deserved the crown, he'd earn it without the king's intercession. If found unworthy, so be it. Bran found the Continent's long history of dynastic rule preposterous. Birna, on the other hand, could not be persuaded to feel the same...
reward_tree_bran_chest_3;Bran lived a long life – a very long life. When, just after his eightieth birthday, his hands began to tremble and his thoughts began to wander mid-sentence, he set out with a small hunting party. Wearing only delicate linens and armed with only a knife, he departed for An Skellig in search of a bear... And an honorable death.
reward_tree_bran_story_pt1;They say it is easier to tame the seas crashing against Skellige's shores than the Skelligers themselves. Yet Bran did just that. He united the isles and the clans behind him – and long ruled with an iron fist.
reward_tree_bran_story_pt2;What was his secret? How did he succeed when others failed? Was it courage? Cunning? Intimidation? No, nothing of the sort. Bran tapped into a power previously unknown to the isles' inhabitants – compromise.
reward_tree_bran_story_pt3;When others would reach for ax and bow, Bran invited his rivals to banquet. With honey-sweet words, purses laden with coin, and barrels heavy with mead, it proved difficult to disagree with Skellige's king for long.
reward_tree_bran_story_pt4;Despite never slaying an ice giant or raiding the City of Golden Towers, Bran is remembered as a truly great ruler. Though not a hero in his own right, he delivered peace to the Isles, ushering in a period of growth and prosperity for the next generation of Skellige's champions.

reward_tree_brouver_chest_1;Brouver Hoog would happily sever all contact between Mahakam and the rest of the world. He sees other races as a threat to centuries-old dwarven traditions and culture, in constant danger of being subsumed beneath the thinly veiled guise of assimilation. For this reason, daily life in this mountainous region is tightly controlled. The Council of Clans issues decrees that regulate even the minutest of matters. Suspenders – admissible or not? May folk eat carp just after it has been prepared, or must its bed of jelly first congeal? Is playing the ocarina in line with the stalwart traditions of the dwarven race, or is it a nefarious import from the rotting, decadent culture of humans? And if the former, has it in the meanwhile become simply uncouth?
reward_tree_brouver_chest_2;Elder Brouver Hoog changes his mind about as often as he shaves – which is never. Rulers of the human domains quickly realized they would not buy his favor with fancy gifts, nor intimidate him to action with fanciful threats. The sole way an elder as stubborn as Brouver can be influenced is through the invocation of some long-forgotten dwarven law or some precedent upon which to base one’s plea. Many a king has rushed to fabricate some scrap of an ancient code allegedly lost to time, so as to call upon it when debating the Mahakaman leader…
reward_tree_brouver_chest_3;While mages throughout the Continent worry continually about the prophesied danger that is the White Frost, Brouver Hoog impatiently awaits its arrival. For far beneath the earth’s surface, in the mountains’ very bowels, the dwarves have hollowed out whole cities, where temperatures are stable, and mushrooms grow plentifully without need of any sunlight. So even should the Frost encase the Continent for centuries, the dwarves will be just fine. Then, after the Great Thaw, they will emerge into a world freed of the human scourge.
reward_tree_brouver_story_pt1;Brouver Hoog, Mahakam’s elder-in-chief, is quite the controversial figure amongst nonhumans. Some see him as the Elder Races’ last chance for survival, while others perceive in him solely cowardly traitor. How did the voices come to be so divided? To find out, we will need to venture back more than two centuries…
reward_tree_brouver_story_pt2;It was around that time that the elves embarked upon a final, desperate attempt to rid the Continent of humans. A messenger arrived in Mahakam. With an impassioned voice, he spoke of the need for solidarity between the Elder Races. Brouver Hoog listened… then promptly threw him out of dwarven homeland and slammed the gates shut behind him.
reward_tree_brouver_story_pt3;While humans and elves tore at each other’s throats, Brouver waited. Ten, twenty, thirty years… A whole century passed before Mahakam re-opened its doors. Eagerly, the dwarves awaited the first arrivals from the valleys… and any news of the war.
reward_tree_brouver_story_pt4;The elves had suffered total defeat. Their domains had been reduced to utter ruin, and their youth had bled to death on battlefields stretching from the Dragon Mountains all the way to Angren. Had Brouver Hoog answered their call those centuries past, the dwarves would surely have shared the elves’ fate. Thanks to the elder-in-chief’s foresight, Mahakam had flourished in the meantime… though not unburdened, a measure of guilt weighing upon it.

reward_tree_calanthe_chest_1;As history tells us, Calanthe was the last to ever reign as Queen of Cintra. During the First Nilfgaardian War, Emhyr var Emreis moved to assimilate the neighboring kingdom into his empire. The Lioness of Cintra, as she was fondly known, defended her ancestral home with great ferocity – enduring grave wounds herself. Yet, sensing the castle's immininent ruin, she ordered her courtiers to deliver her a knife with which she could take her own life. None dared comply and play part in their queen's demise. Alas, their defiance was in vain, for Calanthe then simply threw herself from the tower's highest window.
reward_tree_calanthe_chest_2;Sadly, the queen's body was never found—likely trampled beyond recognition into blood-soaked mud by Nilfgaardian heavy infantry. Following the war, two glorious monuments were erected in her honor: one in Skellige, where she was symbolically laid to rest beside her beloved husband, and the other beneath the Cintra Castle by the request of Emhyr var Emreis, her conqueror. It seems—for reasons likely known only to him—the Nilfgaardian emperor felt bitter remorse over the queen's death...
reward_tree_calanthe_chest_3;Calanthe's veins carried the blood of an ancient Aen Elle line—that of Lara Dorren, one of the Aen Saevherne, or elven sages as they are commonly known. Though the Lioness of Cintra didn't inherit the magical talents of the elder blood, such an affinity did reveal itself in her daughter, Pavetta, and thereafter in her granddaughter, Cirilla. Yet given Calanthe's infamous temper, perhaps such a fate was for the best. To think what she would have been capable of had she been versed in the arcane magical arts...
reward_tree_calanthe_story_pt1;Calanthe—or Calanthe Fiona Riannon, to be precise—was oft referred to under two monikers. Throughout the Continent she was known as the "Lioness of Cintra," and on the Skellige Isles as "Ard Rhena"—that is, the "High Queen." Both names fit her better than even the finest pair of silken gloves.
reward_tree_calanthe_story_pt2;Calanthe proved as valiant as she was stern. At the mere sight of her, boisterous warriors would fall utterly silent, and even the most vainglorious counts stooped low in bow. Few dared to act against her will, and fewer still would repeat their mistake.
reward_tree_calanthe_story_pt3;Calanthe had always wished to rule on her own, hence her longtime aversion toward marriage. Yet when she finally decided to wed, the well of eager suitors had run dry. With eyes like green ice, her fearsome gaze did little to melt the hearts of young princes...
reward_tree_calanthe_story_pt4;In the end, Calanthe walked down the aisle on two occasions. Her first husband, Roegner de Salm, gave her an heiress; the second, Eist Tuirseach — true love. It could have made for a beautiful tale... If not for its bitter end.

reward_tree_calveit_chest_1;As a young man, Jan Calveit served in the Magne Division, which was charged with the defense of the Empire's eastern border along the Tir Tochair mountain range. During an expedition against a crew of nomad outlaws roaming the Korath Desert, his unit fell victim to an ambush. Calveit alone escaped with his life. For weeks he wandered the hot sands under a brutal sun, wounded and exhausted. Yet, he eventually returned home... Though forever a changed man.
reward_tree_calveit_chest_2;A deep scar extends diagonally across Emperor Calveit's face. Despite repeated offers from his court mages to hide or remove the mark, the emperor always adamantly refused. "Those who do not reflect upon their mistakes are doomed to repeat them," he asserted. Indeed, it is impossible to forget one's past missteps when they stare back at you in the mirror.
reward_tree_calveit_chest_3;Jan Calveit preferred to observe battle seated in a throne placed at the edge of the battlefield. Even as flaming arrows whistled by and falling stones carved out craters in the earth around him, he would never stand and flee. "Our fates are written in the stars," he would say. "And my day has not yet come."
reward_tree_calveit_story_pt1;Jan Calveit showed great interest in several fields of study, including medicine and astrology. His critics often scoffed at the impracticality of his academic pursuits. One day, they learned just how wrong they were to doubt his investment...
reward_tree_calveit_story_pt2;Calveit founded a medical university in Vicovaro. One of the academy's departments quickly became notorious, for it was said that its scholars – in contrast to most medical practitioners – preferred working with the dead rather than the living...
reward_tree_calveit_story_pt3;Before long, word circulated quickly of lethally wounded soldiers who miraculously returned from the field hospital back into the fray on the field of battle. Oddly, the soldiers now hid their faces. Under no circumstances would they remove their helmets...
reward_tree_calveit_story_pt4;Greatly upset by the ghastly rumors of soldiers returning from the dead, Nilfgaardian aristocrats conspired to assassinate their Emperor. Yet, their plotting was extinguished as quickly as it began. But how? A traitor in their midst? Not at all, for Calveit's astrologers had long foreseen their treachery.

reward_tree_cat_2_story_chest;Brehen never considered saving the princess. Even if the myths were true⁠—and he seriously doubted it⁠—breaking the curse would be a lot more work and certainly more dangerous. The risk just wasn’t worth the reward. Besides, witchers were made for killing and Brehen had no intention of exhausting himself any more than he had to. The bounty would still stand if he claimed self-defence and no one else would be around to prove otherwise. So, on the next full moon, with weapons prepped and decoctions consumed, the Cat of Iello crept into the vaults beneath the forsaken palace, ready to end the murderous reign of the striga once and for all. Upon seeing her muscular physique, deadly-sharp claws, and hideous form, Brehen showed no fear nor concern. On the contrary, he scoffed at the sight of the cursed princess and sneered mockingly: “You’re not my first royal.” Alas, she would be his last.
reward_tree_cat_2_story_pt1;As a member of the Feline witchers, Brehen’s training focused on speed, precision, and agility—a skill set perfect for the nefarious acts of assassination ofttimes connected to the School of the Cat. So, despite his versatility during combat, one could say the most flexible thing about Brehen was his morality... and they’d be right.
reward_tree_cat_2_story_pt2;Like most of his kin, Brehen was a rogue and an outcast. Prone to bouts of heightened emotion and erratic behaviour—attributed to the school’s warped mutation process—Brehen’s volatile nature was infamous. Mostly due to his hand in the massacre at the town of Iello, which forever branded him with the shady moniker: Cat of Iello.
reward_tree_cat_2_story_pt3;Upon travelling to Vizima—where he intended to claim the reward for curing King Foltest’s daughter of her monstrous curse—Brehen had a chance encounter with Geralt at The Wild Boar and Stag tavern. Believing the rival witcher was out to steal the bounty for himself, Brehen confronted the White Wolf. Whether it was confidence in his own fighting prowess, or the knowledge that Geralt was currently unarmed, Brehen attempted to coerce his opponent into a duel, declaring that only one of them would make it out alive.
reward_tree_cat_2_story_pt4;As luck would have it, a fight between the Cat of Iello and the Butcher of Blaviken would not take place. Instead, an impromptu delivery of Geralt’s swords shifted the dynamic of the situation, and Brehen’s confidence seemingly vanished along with his advantage. Not wanting to risk facing the Wolf’s fury on equal footing, the Cat conceded and vanished into the night, never to meet Geralt - nor any other witcher - ever again.

reward_tree_cat_avatar_chest_1;How was it that the fates of Geralt and Ciri – a witcher and a princess of Cintra – became forever intertwined? The Law of Surprise. After the witcher had lifted the curse afflicting Duny, the Urcheon of Erlenwald, he was asked what he desired as reward. Geralt replied, "That which you find at home, yet did not expect." Shortly thereafter, Duny would learn that his wife Pavetta was with child - Ciri. Though Geralt had no intention of encforcing the Law, it had simply become a matter of destiny...
reward_tree_cat_avatar_chest_2;A dark period of Ciri's life came when she joined a bandit gang known as the "Rats." Constantly on the run, exhausted, Ciri had found a semblance of refuge among the young, cutthroat outlaws. At first, she refused to kill as they did, though her reluctance wouldn't last long. To her own horror, she enjoyed killing - and she was good at it. Eventually, however, her comrades were slaughtered to the last. Ciri barely survived and was nursed back from the brink of death under the care of a hermit, Vysogota of Corvo. Had events turned out differently, who knows... Perhaps Ciri would be known today not as a heroine, but as a villain.
reward_tree_cat_avatar_chest_3;Before Cintra fell to ruin, as a young princess, Ciri would spend her holidays on the Skellige Isles at the family estate of Clan an Craite. It was there with the jarl's children that she learned to ice-skate. As fate would have it, this skill would later save her life when confronted by Nilfgaardian assassins on the frozen waters of Tarn Mira. In a dense, milky fog, the assailants could only hear the eerie scrape of her skates, coming from all directions... Followed swiftly by blood-chilling screams of surprise and pain as they fell one by one to her blade.
reward_tree_cat_avatar_story_pt1;Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon. The Lion Cub of Cintra, Swallow, Zirael, Falka, Child of the Elder Blood, the Lady of Time and Space. An impressive collection of monikers for an impressive woman.
reward_tree_cat_avatar_story_pt2;Daughter to Pavetta and Duny, the young princess enjoyed an early childhood of royal splendor. But then everything changed... Cintra was engulfed in flames and violence, Ciri forced to flee from family and home...
reward_tree_cat_avatar_story_pt3;Eventually, she found a new home in Kaer Morhen, a witchers' fortress and seat of the School of the Wolf. There, under the watchful eye of Geralt of Rivia, she began a grueling training regimen. And it's good that she did, because this peace of her stay there would not last forever... And it couldn't, for after all, the Elder Blood flowed through her veins.
reward_tree_cat_avatar_story_pt4;Due to her lineage, Ciri was endowed with extraordinary gift - the ability to traverse time and space. However, she quickly began to see her ability not as a blessing, but as a curse. For many obsessively coveted her power and sought to exploit it at any cost...
reward_tree_cat_avatar_title;Ciri
reward_tree_cat_border_chest_1;Members of the School of the Cat are ill-famed due to their penchant for frenzy and bloodlust in the heat of battle. Even when their enemies capitulate, beg for mercy... They never stop killing. The inhabitants of Honorton learned this truth in the most brutal fashion. Instead of rewarding a Feline witcher for a contract fulfilled, they withheld their coin and skewered him with pitchfork instead. Gaetan – so was the monster slayer's name – survived the treacherous blow, yet the bloodshed did not stop there... The witcher slaughtered the entire village – men, women, children, the sick and feeble... It mattered not who had a hand in his betrayal. Only one survived the massacre, a young lass named Millie...
reward_tree_cat_border_chest_2;What makes witchers from Cat school so cruel and impetuous? It is widely believed to be a side effect of their mutations. While emotions are suppressed in other witchers, the alchemical cocktail used in the School of the Cat had apparently intensified them. Before the error that tainted the formula could be corrected, it was already too late – a new generation of Feline witchers was born. A generation who would seize control of the School... And had no intention of changing the formula.
reward_tree_cat_border_chest_3;Although Ciri trained at the School of the Wolf, she wore a Feline witcher's medallion. She had claimed it from the lifeless body of infamous bounty hunter Leo Bonhart. Bonhart had boasted that he was one of few to ever best a witcher in combat – and several at that – as evidenced by the three silver medallions fastened to his belt. The swordmaster never claimed a fourth, however, as Ciri spilled his blood over the cold cobblestones of Stygga Castle.
reward_tree_cat_border_story_pt1;Each witcher school holds a unique reputation. Bears - sulkers and firebrands. Wolves - traditionalists. And Cats? Prone to use steel swords more often than silver.
reward_tree_cat_border_story_pt2;Unlike other witchers, those from the School of the Cat were not committed to a position of neutrality. As a result, they were often hired as spies and assassins. And it's no wonder – assassinating a nobleman usually paid better than slaying a drowner.
reward_tree_cat_border_story_pt3;The ill repute of Feline witchers became increasingly notorious in royal circles. After a time, kings and queens began to fear in earnest for their lives. For the witchers, however, this came not as a point of pride, but one of concern, for rulers do not like to feel threatened...
reward_tree_cat_border_story_pt4;One day, an army marched onto the grounds of the School of the Cat. For three days the blood-soaked slaughter persisted, but eventually every last defending witcher perished. As for those who were not present during the attack? They continue to roam the world's roads - embittered, hungry for vengeance, with nothing left to lose...

reward_tree_cc_chest_1;Eltibald derived his prophecies not only from his observations of celestial bodies, but also from inscriptions found on sepulchers and menhirs of the Wozgor and Dauk peoples – human cultures considered among the Continent's most ancient and mysterious. Ultimately, he came to discover the Crimson Curse after examining sacrificial stone slabs of the Svalblod cult in Skellige. According to the isles' inhabitants, the cruel, deity-like being had already been vanquished once and for all. Alas, they could not have been further from the truth...
reward_tree_cc_chest_2;Of course, intelligent monsters had known of the Crimson Curse far earlier than humans. Higher vampires, knockers, sylvans... All sensed the red moon's approach—and all awaited it with eager anticipation. For they knew such an opportunity to settle their grudges against humankind may never again present itself.
reward_tree_cc_chest_3;Historians have long been fascinated by a particular conundrum: how is it that humans rule over the Continent, from the Dragon Mountains to the Great Sea, while monsters – whether werebbubb or godling, fiend or leshen – possess the greater strength? That humans to this day force these powerful beasts deeper into dense woodlands and mountain caves? Some scholars argue that the success of mankind lies in its capacity to build complex social structures, whereas monsters are blindly driven by their appetite for blood. Ever with the sharp intellect and loose tongue, Regis once mused over the question with his close friend, Dettlaff van der Eretein. Regis could not have known, however, how his words that fateful day would forever shift the course of history...
reward_tree_cc_story_pt1;Since the dawn of time, people have peered with curious eyes into the night sky. Among the stars, they've sought signs from the gods, even prophecies of the future. For some, it has worked—though often at the price of losing their minds.
reward_tree_cc_story_pt2;One such clairvoyant was a mage by the name of Eltibald, who foretold the impending arrival of the Black Sun. His next work was meant to herald an even graver misfortune... Alas, he passed away before the manuscript could be completed.
reward_tree_cc_story_pt3;Eltibald's unfinished manuscript bore the title "The Crimson Curse; or, Evil's Awakening." In this tome, he prophesied that once the moon turns a crimson hue, monsters – those previously hidden to humankind – would emerge to feast on flesh and blood.
reward_tree_cc_story_pt4;Eltibald's apprentices considered his latest treatise to be the ravings of a madman, and thus, in the interest of preserving the renowned mage's legacy, kept them hidden from public view.

reward_tree_cd1_leadership_story_chest_1;Whether beloved, admired, respected, or feared, leadership takes on many facets, from the staunch determination of visionary monarchs to the reigning terror favored by gang leaders. While some have power thrust upon them⁠—bound by duty and obligation⁠—others harbor the deep-seated drive to claim greatness and rise above the rest. Yet most would-be leaders, void of favorable heritage, must acquire such positions via brute force and bloodshed. After all, it's impossible to keep one's hands clean while leading a Scoia'tael commando or overseeing the unruly and violent "organizations" of Novigrad. And woe to those who try to control monsters without inexorable displays of dominance. When any hint of benevolence is viewed as weakness, a leader must ensure they strike constant fear into the hearts of all, friend and foe alike.
reward_tree_cd1_leadership_story_chest_2;Terror-infused carnage indeed makes for a rousing legacy, and bloodlust and aggression⁠—as the natives of Skellige have demonstrated time and again⁠—can undoubtedly prove useful. In the short term, at least. However, real longevity of power blossoms from a more calm and calculated approach to leadership: Why fling oneself into the fray like a frenzied hound when one can simply take a moment to stand back, analyze the situation, and act accordingly. For intelligence and patience have won far more battles than hot-headed fury, with far fewer casualties. It takes but a glimpse at the Nilfgaardian expanse to see just how efficient shrewd diplomacy can be⁠—albeit with an ample supply of treachery thrown in for good measure.
reward_tree_cd1_leadership_story_chest_3;When it comes to the loyalty of one's subjects, there's no denying that fear makes for an excellent motivator. Yet, support found in such a way tends to be fleeting and often dissipates at the first sign of vulnerability. An uprising here, a coup there⁠—brutality breeds brutality, it has long been known. In fact, many would argue respect and admiration build sturdier foundations and command far stronger patronage; a notion embraced by many of the Northern Realms' rulers for centuries; for they've long affirmed that fearmongering and coercion pale in comparison to the steadfast devotion of truly faithful vassals.

reward_tree_cleaver_chest_1;The non-humans of Novigrad knew all too well the city guard has no intention of improving their lot in life. In fact, they often do the exact opposite. For this reason, in non-human quarters of Novigrad, Carlo "Cleaver" Varese maintains order. Those who cooperate with Cleaver praise the protection he offers. But be warned, for those who refuse it are often never heard from again.
reward_tree_cleaver_chest_2;Cleaver prefers to conduct business in the city baths because it is difficult to smuggle in a blade under one's towel and, should negotiations call for a stronger hand, a bare-knuckle resolution works to Cleaver's advantage. With fists the size of rye loaves, the brawl and subesequent business arrangement often conclude in his favor.

But not Cleaver. With chest bared, tattoos and jewelry in full view, and his greased mohawk glistening in the sun, he's rather difficult to miss.

reward_tree_crach_chest_1;Due to the havoc wrought by his fleets in the Empire's coastal territories, Crach earned the moniker "Tirth ys Muire" – the Wild Boar of the Sea. Pleased with the new epithet, Crach decided to sculpt the bow of his drakkar into the likeness of raging boar's head. According to legend, they harvested the wood from Gedyneith, the sacred oak of Ard Skellig. The drakkar instilled fear into the hearts of enemies, for whenever they rammed into an enemy vessel, the wild boar's eyes would glow blood red...
reward_tree_crach_chest_2;Crach an Craite fathered two children – his son, Hjalmar, and his daughter, Cerys. When asked whom he would wish to see as heir and successor, he could only sigh, conflicted by his thoughts. Hjalmar reminded Crach of his younger self – ambitious, valiant, hungry for glory. An impressive warrior, yes... But a jarl? Cerys, on the other hand, possessed all the qualities required of a capable leader. But were the islanders prepared to follow the word of a woman? Only time would tell...
reward_tree_crach_chest_3;As a young man – his beard a rich auburn, his smile broad, the famed vanquisher of the Nilfgaardian armada – Crach stole the gaze of many women. Why, even the famous Yennefer of Vengerberg was enticed by Crach's charm. According to rumor, he asked for the sorceress' hand in marriage. In response, Yennefer smiled, kissed him on his brow... then opened a portal and disappeared from the Skellige Isles for nearly three decades.
reward_tree_crach_story_pt1;At a young age, Crach was foretold that he would one day clash with a foreign ruler, an enemy to Skellige, on the Isles' stormy, coastal seas. For his entire life, the head of Clan an Craite waited for that fateful day...

Though when the world is bound in ice, as well as in recent memory, Dana Méadbh has begun to appear more frequently... Alas, this is no reason to rejoice, for the Queen of the Fields is angry. Rather than show gratitude for nature's plentiful bounty, the world's inhabitants instead continue to tear and plunder away ever more. The time has come they were taught a lesson – one that shall be remembered for a long, long while.
reward_tree_dana_chest_2;Drawn more to dead rock than living plants and beasts, dwarves possess the weakest connection with nature. Despite this apparent lack of affinity, they too worship Dana Méadbh, yet call her by another name: Bloëmenmagde. They demonstrate their honor by laying wreaths of hops and jars of pickled fungi at a crossroads. None know whether Lyfia, as she is sometimes known, truly enjoys such offerings... But the knockers of the surrounding mountains certainly do.
reward_tree_dana_chest_3;Dana Méadbh sometimes takes the form of a ordinary woman, using her guise to live amongst mortals. She does not speak, as if mute, staying clear of the beaten path, yet observes all with a keen eye. In those villages where the peasantfolk do not weed the poppies and cornflowers from their fields of rye, where they treat their cows to the delight of carrots, Lyfia multiplies their bounty. Yet where peasants treat the land not as mother but slave, so comes the devastation of frost and hail...
reward_tree_dana_story_pt1;Sometimes, on a hot summer's day, you might spot the silhouette of a young woman in the heart of a birch grove, surrounded by dancing butterflies with a crown of flowers atop her head. The elves call her Dana Méadbh. To humans, she is Lyfia, or the Queen of the Fields.
reward_tree_dana_story_pt2;Not even the greatest of the elven sages know who – or what – she truly is. Some consider her a goddess, others – the forces of nature embodied. Though one thing is for certain: without her presence, the Continent would sit as a lifeless rock in the sea.
reward_tree_dana_story_pt3;It is Dana Méadbh who awakens plants and beasts at the advent of spring, who nurtures the buds of delicate flowers. Wherever she steps, the land bestows its bounty. Where she treads not, stalks snap, flowers wilt, and harvests wane.
reward_tree_dana_story_pt4;For a long time, Dana Méadbh refused to meddle in the affairs of mortals. She held love for all races. Yet the balance of the world was disturbed and Lyfia sought to restore it. By force, if necessary.

reward_tree_demavend_chest_1;Although all now are too young to recall, Demavend was once a strapping young man. Foltest himself would have envied the man's eagle-like profile. Maidens swooned when caught under the gaze of his piercing emerald eyes. But years of plenty have taken their toll. A plump belly and rosy cheeks show clearly that the king was never want for sumptuous food and drink. His saggy neck and hunched shoulders proved further that he preferred to command his armies from a silk-lined throne in place of a saddle...
reward_tree_demavend_chest_2;Demavend's hatred for elves was legendary. While Vizimir and Foltest fought the Squirrels out of necessity, the King of Aedirn hunted the rebels down with astonishing enthusiasm. Despite the fact that the war with Nilfgaard had nearly drained Aedirn's royal treasury, Demavend offered 50 ducats for every Scoia'tael head. Taking advantage of the lucrative bounty, Aedirnians often falsely accused and captured innocent elves and dwarves. Demavend was perfectly aware his subjects were exploiting the offer. And yet, he didn't seem bothered in the least...
reward_tree_demavend_chest_3;Under his crown, Demavend always wore a white cap embroidered with gold thread – undeterred even by the sweltering summer months. Why? It seems the vain king was ashamed of his retreating hairline. Many alchemists and barbers passed through his court, offering promises to restore the Aedirnian ruler's lustrous mane. Each of them, to the last, spent their remaining days in the Aldersberg dungeons for their failure – deprived of freedom... and their own scalps.
reward_tree_demavend_story_pt1;Demavend possessed many traits that predisposed the king for greatness. Well-educated, shrewd, cunning, a master of political intrigue. Unfortunately, he was also very, very impatient.
reward_tree_demavend_story_pt2;King Demavend was never satisfied with the present. He always looked to tomorrow, to the great feats of his future, shrugging off the mundane tasks of the court. Whilst his advisers bored him with the nuances of prudent fiscal policy, he quietly planned his next conquest...
reward_tree_demavend_story_pt3;Aedirn's neighbors learned quickly that Demavend could never be appeased with compromise. His kingdom expanded like dough baked in too small a bread pan, pushing and stretching in all directions. Not unlike the Nilfgaardian Empire...
reward_tree_demavend_story_pt4;When Nilfgaardian forces eventually crossed the Yaruga, a panicked fear struck deeply in all the rulers of the North. All except for King Demavend, that is. He rejoiced, for at last he would face an enemy worthy of Aedirn's might! Of course... His jubilation would not last long.

reward_tree_dettlaff_chest_1;Witchers used to classify higher vampires as a distinct species. However, their logic was not fully sound, for each possesses its own unique character and abilities. Regis, for example, was a loner endowed with extraordinary intellect. Dettlaff, by contrast, seemed destined to lead a flock. Lower forms of vampires such as katakans, ekimmaras, and bruxae answered his every call without delay. The inhabitants of Beauclair would quickly learn the disastrous consequences of such overwhelming control...
reward_tree_dettlaff_chest_2;Perhaps the most distinctive piece of Dettlaff's attire is a jewel-encrusted brooch crafted in the shape of a moth – a gift bestowed to him by Regis. Dettlaff viewed the token as a symbol of his connection with the night. Regis, however, held a different association in mind. He knew his friend, driven primal urges, would – like a moth – always be drawn back to the light. Even if that meant he would one day be consumed by the flames.
reward_tree_dettlaff_chest_3;After Dettlaff slayed four knights of Toussaint guilty of despicable acts, he became known to Toussaintois as the Beast of Beauclair. Sentenced to death for the killings, the Toussaint court summoned a witcher to track and kill the unknown monster. Dettlaff could but watch on in utter disbelief, for the widely adored Duchess Anna Henrietta has condemned dozens to the scaffold for much, much less! Even the monster slayer called to Toussaint had more innocent lives on his conscience than the alleged beast he was commissioned to kill! This was the tipping point. Dettlaff decided to no longer adhere to the laws of men. He would instead impose upon them the vampiric code of honor – a system founded on the harshest punishments...
reward_tree_dettlaff_story_pt1;Dettlaff once tried to live among people in peace. He muzzled his bloodlust, mastered the Common Speech, and perfected the basics of courtly etiquette. Over time, he began to make friends of humans... And in one in particular, he found a lover.
reward_tree_dettlaff_story_pt2;His beloved's name was Syanna. Dettlaff's love for her was absolute. He was prepared to do any and all for her. In fact, Syanna made ample use of his love-driven dedication... That is, until the day she vanished without a trace or a word.
reward_tree_dettlaff_story_pt3;Syanna likely assumed that Dettlaff would swallow the bitter pill of rejection like all her lovers before him. Alas, the reasoning of vampires works differently than in men. And so, too, did Dettlaff's fury burn more fiercely.
reward_tree_dettlaff_story_pt4;Dettlaff felt scorned not only by Syanna, but by the entire human race. He took them all for traitors, hypocrites, and deceivers. Unfortunately, even but a brief look back on the Continent's history shows us he is not altogether wrong...

reward_tree_dire_rat_chest;Some say that the Wererat is just an urban legend. Others swear that they have seen him in the sewers – just not in one particular city. So one could get the impression that the humanoid rat liked to live in the sewers of every large human community on the Continent. Or that there were simply more of them. Wererats, that is. There was even a rumor, that the people who lived through the epidemic are not humans anymore.\nAt least not everyday.
reward_tree_dire_rat_story_pt1;Rats can be found everywhere. At least everywhere, where people live.
reward_tree_dire_rat_story_pt2;For example the itinerant rat (rattus nordlicus, according to the Oxenfurt classification) along with humans, has colonized the entire Continent, and most likely, also the lands beyond the sea. One could think that rats, and not the dogs, are human's best friend.\nNothing could be more wrong.
reward_tree_dire_rat_story_pt3;Rats are the harbingers of human misfortune. They destroy property, eat the supplies and carry diseases. Their tiny claws and teeth can prove deadlier than the largest war machines. While they will not level an entire city, they can easily kill all its inhabitants… All it takes is one infected animal. One tiny cut that brings the worst for humans.\nThe plague.
reward_tree_dire_rat_story_pt4;No one can foresee the town and time that the Plague Maiden will send her rats to. Similarly, no one can tell which disease they will spread. What will the symptoms be? When you hear the stories about the dreadful mutations among the infected, who nevertheless still lived…\nDeath seems to be the merciful option.
reward_tree_draconic_avatar_chest_1;The identity of Saskia's mother remains a mystery, though evidence suggests she was Myrgtabrakke – a dragon once the target of a hunting expedition led by King Niedamir of Caingorn. Who took part in the campaign to slay her? The question, rather, is who did not! The party included Yarpen Zigrin and his dwarves, Eyck of Denesle, Yennefer of Vengerberg, Dorregaray of Vole, the Crinfrid Reavers, and even the legendary Geralt of Rivia himself... And yet, somehow, Myrgtabrakke lived. How, you ask? It's unknown for certain, for none on the expedition ever wished to speak of it...
reward_tree_draconic_avatar_chest_2;It was Saskia's dream to establish a new kingdom in the Pontar Valley, at the junction of Kaedwen and Aedirn. All races – elves, dwarves, humans, halflings, and gnomes – were to live there in peace, free from prejudice and discrimination. A beautiful dream, indeed... Yet extremely difficult to realize.
reward_tree_draconic_avatar_chest_3;After reading Saskia's spirited, impassioned speeches, it's difficult to walk away without an impression that she was unusually... naive. Would an experienced politician believe that a peasant uprising could defeat King Henselt's army? That the Scoia'tael would abandon the forest in order to defend the lives of humans and dwarves? That the Lodge of Sorceresses would provide aid with no ulterior motive? And yet... Such dreamers are needed, for it is only they who can change the world for the better.
reward_tree_draconic_avatar_story_pt1;Saskia held several monikers. Queen of the Pontar Valley, the Virgin of Aedirn, the Dragonslayer. Hmm, well... In retrospect, we know that at least two of these titles were undeserved.
reward_tree_draconic_avatar_story_pt2;For now, let us leave matters of the bedchamber left to unspoken speculation and focus on her title of "Dragonslayer." In fact, she had never slayed a dragon... Nor had she ever an intent to take her own life.
reward_tree_draconic_avatar_story_pt3;Yes, yes, you understood that correctly. Saskia – or rather Saesenthessis, as that was her full name – was none other than a golden dragon, a being able to assume any form...
reward_tree_draconic_avatar_story_pt4;But that begs the question... Why assume human form? Why meddle in human affairs? In all likelihood, she inherited her fondness for people from her father, Villentretenmerth.

reward_tree_draconic_border_chest_1;As surely as the sun rises with each day, people deathly afraid of dragons. That is... With exception of the Zerrikanians. Should you believe the tales of travelers returning from the Continent's far east, the folk of Zerrikania make sacrifices to the reptiles and erect temples in their honor. What's more, they consider dragons the embodiment of virtue and beauty. Any who raises sword or bow against one shall suffer punishment of the greatest severity. What truth can be found in such stories, however, is difficult to discern...
reward_tree_draconic_border_chest_2;Dragons are a rare sight on the Continent, yet accounts of destruction wrought by the beasts still widely circulates. When an expert arrives at the scene of an attack – a witcher, as is often the case – they often conclude it's not the work of a dragon. Far more commonly, a slyzard, forktail, or wyvern is the culprit. Rumor has it, golden dragons find such comparisons highly offensive...
reward_tree_draconic_border_chest_3;The most famous of dragons was likely Villentretenmerth – known in his human form as Borch Three Jackdaws. Unlike others of his species, he had sympathy for humans and enjoyed spending time with them. This was especially true in the comfort of taverns and inns, the tables heavy with hearty fare, in the company of troubadors and the fierce female warriors of Zerrikania...
reward_tree_draconic_border_story_pt1;Green, red, black, white, gold... There are several dragon varieties. They differ in color, of course, but also in size, intelligence, and their abilities. So, in what way are they alike? Simple. They're all deadly.
reward_tree_draconic_border_story_pt2;Perhaps it is because of their deadliness that witchers do not accept contracts on dragons. They point to their mysterious witchers' code as the reason, yet it is rather apparent that even the famed monster slayers fear these particular draconids.
reward_tree_draconic_border_story_pt3;Because witchers refuse to slay dragons, the task falls to other would-be heroes. Sometimes, a knight-errant may vow to duel the winged beast. Other times, local peasants may seek to protect their village the best way they know how... By stuffing a sheep's carcass with poison.
reward_tree_draconic_border_story_pt4;Regardless of the method, however, most attempts at dragonslaying usually end poorly for the would-be slayers. Yet, if that's true, where are all the dragons? Well, according to legend, they have flown across the Great Sea, to lands as yet untainted by humankind.
reward_tree_draconic_border_title;Season of the Draconid
reward_tree_draconid_2_story_chest;After a great and successfully unsuccessful hunt, Myrgtabrakke gave her barely hatched daughter to Villentretenmerth, in return for the rescue and for her own safety⁠—a “Dragon of Surprise”, one could say. Later, Myrg went into hiding far away from human settlements, and away from any other dragon. Away from everything. She had always been a loner, and her clash with the hunting party of King Niedamir⁠—especially with Barefield’s loud rabble⁠—only confirmed that she preferred solitude to the company of others.\nNonetheless, Myrgtabrakke kept a watchful eye on her daughter.\nShe usually did this out of sight, because Saesenthessis, known as Saskia by common folk, for some incomprehensible reason, was interested in both human and non-human matters. Myrgtabrakke, although she was unable to quite understand, never interfered in her daughter’s curious affairs, nor ever tried to stop her.\nBut she watched. Always. Ensuring that Saesenthessis was never, ever truly alone.
reward_tree_draconid_2_story_pt1;Myrgtabrakke belonged to the most common variety of dragons. The green ones. Unfortunately, due to the similar coloration of the scales, they are notoriously mistaken for slyzards. Despite the species’ name, they often appear to be greenish gray, or grayish green, similar to that of the lesser draconids. As a result, these intelligent reptiles are more actively hunted than any other type of dragon.
reward_tree_draconid_2_story_pt2;One of the most famous hunts in the history of the North concerned Myrgtabrakke herself, with the event owing its fame to the legendary hunting party. Led by Niedamir, King of Caingorn, its participants⁠—not counting almost half of Barefield’s residents⁠—comprised Yarpen Zigrin and his company of dwarves, Boholt and his Crinfrid Reavers, Eyck of Denesle, mages Dorregaray of Vole and Yennefer of Vengerberg, witcher Geralt of Rivia with his friend Dandelion, and finally, the knight Borch Three Jackdaws, known also by another name … A dragon's name.
reward_tree_draconid_2_story_pt3;So while most of the party pursued the wounded Myrgtabrakke for various compensations, the witcher and the knight took part in the hunt for quite different reasons. Geralt, unable to escape the bond between him and the sorceress, found himself once again⁠—and not for the last time⁠⁠—following Yennefer. Meanwhile, Villentretenmerth, using the name Borch Three Jackdaws among humans, joined the famous ensemble for one reason, and one reason alone: to save Myrgtabrakke.
reward_tree_draconid_2_story_pt4;When the hunters finally reached the cave where Myrgtabrakke was hiding, it came to light why the dragon didn’t just scurry away, easily escaping her imminent slaughter. She would not abandon her egg and leave the precious life within at the mercy of the self-proclaimed monster slayers⁠—brazen hunters who cared not if the creature was actually intelligent. Fortunately, witchers still had their “code”, and Geralt of Rivia helped Villentretenmerth save the green dragon and her offspring. As for the other party members ... Well, instead of treasure and prestige, they only found their bloodlust repaid in kind.

reward_tree_dryad_2_story_chest;Long ago, Aglaïs promised herself something in secret.\nAs fate would have it, thanks to her notable skills, she was able to keep that promise. From an early age, when she was just a grub crawling among the trees, she showed an innate talent for healing, even among hamadryads. This was why Lady Eithné never compelled her to take up arms; never forced Aglaïs to break her vow of pacifism—not even during times of war. The healer loathed the thought of killing. She accepted death as the natural end of all living things, but rejected the possibility that she could ever inflict it upon others.\nAnd so she never did.
reward_tree_dryad_2_story_pt1;Aglaïs was the chief healer in Col Serrai, the famous hot spring basin, when Geralt of Rivia arrived there—battered and broken. The witcher had been badly wounded during his duel with sorcerer Vilgefortz on Thanedd Island, and was in grave need of help. If it were not for the restorative hand of the hamadryad, he would never have fought again.
reward_tree_dryad_2_story_pt2;The superior healer of Col Serrai was well known for her taciturnity. The reason for this was quite simple: Aglaïs had never seen anybody heal faster due to idle chatter. So she chose her words carefully and talked only when the situation required it. When she didn't have to waste her breath—she didn't.
reward_tree_dryad_2_story_pt3;In addition to the forces of nature, the chief healer used forest water and curative rhizomes—most prominently, the famous combination of conynhael and knitbone. But the key to healing the most grievous of wounds lay with the extraordinary skill of the hamadryad herself.
reward_tree_dryad_2_story_pt4;Amazingly, contrary to popular belief about dryads and their kin, Aglaïs saw no difference between treating humans and non-humans alike. If someone was sick or injured, regardless of who or what they were, she would do whatever she could to make them whole again.

reward_tree_dryad_avatar_chest_1;Triss Merigold is sometimes called the Fourteenth of the Hill. The moniker refers to the Battle of Sodden at which many mages and sorceresses perished while fighting for the North. Struck to the ground with a powerful spell, it seemed Triss had shared the others' fate. Fortunately, it turned out news of her death was somewhat exaggerated...
reward_tree_dryad_avatar_chest_2;When King Radovid V began his hunt for mages, Triss – like many of her colleagues – sought refuge in Novigrad, a neutral city. In place of a haven, however, she and the others found themselves in a trap. Soon the bodies of mages and sorceresses began to pile up, their lives extinguished by the fanatical priests from the Church of the Eternal Fire. Those lucky enough to be spared a gruesome death owe their thanks to Triss... As well as a certain white-haired witcher.
reward_tree_dryad_avatar_chest_3;Triss had countless admirers, but only ever truly loved one – Geralt of Rivia, the White Wolf. The two have endured countless trials together. Salamandra's siege on Kaer Morhen, the putsch at Loc Muinne, the exodus of mages from Novigrad, the battle against the Wild Hunt... Yet, it wasn't all blood and tragedy. That being said, no chronicler of strong repute would dare detail their more... intimate... moments.
reward_tree_dryad_avatar_story_pt1;Contrary to common belief, dryads on rare occasion would permit humans into their forest. Among that privileged minority was Milva Barring, well-known human archer and guide.

reward_tree_eist_chest_1;Eist Tuirseach and Calanthe never bore children. Some claimed that the Lioness of Cintra – for whom this was her second marriage – was incapable of granting an heir due to her advanced age. However, those closest to Eist knew better. The islander never wished to father a child – not after witnessing what power resided within Calanthe's daughter, Pavetta. In the veins of Cintrian royalty flowed the Elder Blood, which he believed would not mix well with the hot temper so characteristic of Skelligers.
reward_tree_eist_chest_2;Eist became renowned on the Isles for his skills as a sailor. He could maneuver a longship through Skellige's narrowest fjords on a moonless night, navigate the fiercest storms at full sail, and drive Nilfgaardian ships more than twice the size of his own onto the islands' jagged, rocky coastlines. Who knows what new and exotic lands he might have discovered had he not planted his roots in Cintra...
reward_tree_eist_chest_3;To ensure his ship never deviated from its course, Eist often closely observed the stars. Yet one night – lying on the deck of his longship, hands clasped behind his head – he eyed something more than just a map etched in sky. He saw something that turned the good-humored, carefree adventurer in him into a grim and somber man. Whenever asked what he saw in the stars that night, Eist merely replied... "The future."
reward_tree_eist_story_pt1;Eist looked different than the other islanders. His hair dark, his skin markedly aged and weathered by the sun – he stood out in a crowd. His appearance, it seemed, paralled a certain longing, for he often looked upon the horizon, his gaze distant, giving the sense that his thoughts were lost somewhere far beyond Skellige's shores...
reward_tree_eist_story_pt2;Eventually, Eist did leave his homeland to settle in Cintra at the side of the illustrious Queen Calanthe. They say one look from the swarthy pirate was enough to melt the queen's icy heart...
reward_tree_eist_story_pt3;Although Eist loved Calanthe beyond measure, he was never truly happy in Cintra. He could not shake the lingering feeling that catastrophe awaited him, that a tragic fate had been written for him in the stars...
reward_tree_eist_story_pt4;Indeed, several years following their wedding, Nilfgaard attacked Cintra. Eist fought the invaders with the fury of a sea devil, but eventually fell, pierced by an arrow.

reward_tree_eithne_chest_1;Dryads possess a power allowing them to influence plants to grow in any shape. In this way they construct their fortifications, homes, and palaces. The process is slow, sometimes lasting centuries... Fortunately, dryads are a patient bunch.
reward_tree_eithne_chest_2;The most gifted dryads are able to push this ability further, to create new life-forms from plants, capable of movement... Even rudimentary thought. These beings are known as treants. Few have laid eyes upon them – knowingly, at least. In a dense forest, they are near impossible to spot... And even more difficult to escape.
reward_tree_eithne_chest_3;From time to time, the human leaders of the realms that border Brokilon – Verden, Cidaris, and Temeria – once again resolve to set ablaze the primeval forest and the dryads who dwell within. Up to the wood's edge they transport barrels of tar and straw. However, they are typically abandoned with haste after the first volley of silent arrows is released from behind the wall of trees.
reward_tree_eithne_story_pt1;Even sworn enemies sometimes negotiate, perhaps in the hope of establishing a compromise or truce. But never Eithné, Queen of the Dryads. Her hatred toward humans is unwavering. To their bargains, pleas, cries, threats, her answer is always the same – a well-aimed arrow between the eyes.
reward_tree_eithne_story_pt2;Under Eithné's leadership, humans are never permitted to enter the forests of Brokilon. Well... Almost never. After all, even dryads must procreate somehow.
reward_tree_eithne_story_pt3;For this reason, dryads will kidnap human girls and, occasionally, men in their prime. Their role in dryad society is easy to guess. However, they are then forever banished from the forest once their "duty" is fulfilled... Despite their impassioned pleas to stay.

reward_tree_eldain_chest_1;It's commonly known that Eldain had a soft spot for music. In fact, prior to joining the Scoia'tael, he frequented human festivals as a lutist. On one occasion, Eldain's forces captured a minstrel who requested to sing rather than utter his final words, in the hopes that Eldain would be swayed to mercy. Indeed, with a grin across his face, Eldain enjoyed and applauded the bard's performance. He then ordered the man flayed alive.
reward_tree_eldain_chest_2;Eldain selected the Moulderwood as the base of his commando's operation, for it was a primordial forest so dense that even under the glare of the noon sun it bore the semblance of twilight. Only two types of human caravans ever traversed it: those surrounded by at least twenty armed guards, and those that never emerged.
reward_tree_eldain_chest_3;When Eldain's commando seized control of the Moulderwood, many Aen Seidhe insisted he rebuild the numerous elven ruins scattered throughout, yet Eldain always refused. Some suspected the ruins benefitted the Scoia'tael by reminding the elves of human cruelty. The truth was much more mundane. Columns serve as better cover when toppled.
reward_tree_eldain_story_pt1;Eldain tried, with all the strength his will could muster, to live in peace among humans. He bowed to his neighbors in respect, brushed off insults and the occasional shove. Yet when the surrounding orchards suffered from blight, a scapegoat was needed. Someone, anyone to blame for their misfortune. Eldain was an elf – and that was enough.
reward_tree_eldain_story_pt2;Eldain joined the Scoia'tael fully aware that their war was doomed to fail, and at the end of that road only death awaited him. He decided, therefore, that his mission in life would be to live on in memories of humans – as a nightmare.

reward_tree_elf_2_story_chest;There was something Ida Emean didn't mention to anyone, not even to Francesca.\nThe elven sage secretly loved the sea.\nShe wasn't ashamed of this feeling, since it would be hard to find something more pure and innocent. She simply liked to keep all sentiments to herself, instead of sharing them with others. Therefore, she watched the sea alone and listened to it carefully, while the waves swept her feet. Open waters somehow reminded her of a long lost home, despite living in the Blue Mountains. Nonetheless, she never said it out loud. Only her appearance could reveal those feelings she kept hidden at the bottom of her heart. She never wore precious metals or mountain stones, always preferring pearls, coral, and amber over them.\nThere was something soothing in those little pieces of jewelry. A small reminder of a home Ida never really had.
reward_tree_elf_2_story_pt1;Red-haired and large-eyed Ida Emean aep Sivney was the second elf – next to Francesca Findabair – in the Lodge of Sorceress, and the only Aen Saevherne there. Though it was not very surprising, since sages are a very rare sight even among the elves and meeting them is considered a great honor.
reward_tree_elf_2_story_pt2;But that’s also why Ida provoked suspicions among other members of the Lodge – by her very presence. The free elves from the Blue Mountains usually avoided not only humans but even their own kind, especially those who lived in close proximity to humans. Regardless, she decided to join their order.
reward_tree_elf_2_story_pt3;Of course, she wasn’t following her heart or acting on impulse. It was pure politics. Since the queen of Dol Blathanna wished her to join the Lodge, Ida did. Otherwise, she would not be meddling in human affairs. After all, history often proved that it brings only trouble.
reward_tree_elf_2_story_pt4;So, after the fall of the Lodge, when Triss Merigold asked her for help in the fight against Wild Hunt, Ida outright refused. No hesitation, no reproach. She could ally with people if the need arose, but she was not going to die for them.\nNot even in a thousand years.

reward_tree_elf_avatar_chest_1;Although more than two hundred years have passed since Aelirenn's rebellion, her memory yet lives on. At the palace of Shaerrawedd, situated in the wilds of Kaedwen, Scoia'tael warriors continue to tend to Aelirenn's beloved garden – her treasured white roses in particular. On occasion, human travelers have inadvertently stumbled upon the hallowed grounds. Enchanted by the beauty of this ivy-strewn relic of the past, some took a rose for posterity – woefully unaware of the flower's cherished significance...
reward_tree_elf_avatar_chest_2;Due to her petite and frail frame, Aelirenn never gained the reputation of legendary warrior. Rather, she is remembered for her ability to orate, to inspire in the face of common sense and better judgment. When she called for war, resistance from the elders proved futile to stop her. The last elven king and his advisers knew full well that defeat on the battlefield would herald the eventual destruction of their race. With tears in their eyes, they watched on from palace windows as the elven kingdom's last line of defense marched off to war in the face of impossible odds.
reward_tree_elf_avatar_chest_3;Aelirenn's banner did not bear a coat of arms nor seal of the elven kingdom. She used but a simple circle, for this represented the globe and thus the scope of her ambitions. The other Elder Races – dwarves, halflings, and gnomes – looked upon the standard with a feeling of unease. They knew not the fate that would await them should the White Rose of Shaerawedd achieve victory... Humans, on the other hand, merely laughed at the sight of the Aelirenn's standard. Why? Because any fool with half a brain knows the world is flat...
reward_tree_elf_avatar_story_pt1;Today, It is commonly believed that the elven kingdom's demise was inevitable. Yet, who can know truly? If not for Aelirenn's intervention, history may have followed an altogether different path.
reward_tree_elf_avatar_story_pt2;Humans and elves had agreed to a peace agreement approximately two hundred years ago. As result of the accord, the kingdom of elves – which had once stretched from the Great Sea to the Blue Mountains – was reduced to a mere scrap of land. Nevertheless... It persisted.
reward_tree_elf_avatar_story_pt3;Then emerged Aelirenn. "No more truces, no more elves on bent knee," she would profess. "This is elven land. We will take back what was stolen! We shall drive the ape-men into the sea!"
reward_tree_elf_avatar_story_pt4;The elders had warned that Aelirenn's plan would likely spell suicide. Despite their protestations, the realm's young and spirited refused to heed the elders' advice, choosing instead to follow Aelirenn's fiery rhetoric. As promised, her warriors would indeed find honor. Honor... And death.

reward_tree_elf_border_chest_1;Elves have a unique aptitude for magic. In fact, it was the Aen Seidhe who created the first spells and helped humans to master them – a gesture of goodwill in the hopes of peaceful coexistence. The elven mages of greatest renown are known as the Aen Saevherne – known more simply as "sages." The world withholds few secrets from these elves, for in addition to magic, they are adept in the fields of alchemy, astronomy, and astrology... Why, even genetics.
reward_tree_elf_border_chest_2;Many Nordlings believe that the roots of the Nilfgaardian people extend far back to an elven tribe sometimes referred to as the Black Seidhe. This would explain much. After all, their language is derived from Elder Speech, the Empire is far more developed than the North, and they treat non-humans with much less hostility... However, the truth behind such characteristics is rather different. Whereas the people of the south simply chose to adopt some of the elves' best traits,  the people of the north opted for slaughter.
reward_tree_elf_border_chest_3;Though elves are quick to paint themselves as victims of human expansion, their own consciences are far from clear. The foothills of the Blue Mountains and the shore of Loc Muinne are strewn with the ruins of ancient Vran cities. Underneath them lie caverns still littered with the bones of this intelligent reptilian race who had dwelled there well before the Aen Seidhe's arrival. Close inspection of their remains suggests that the Vrans were not wiped out by natural causes.
reward_tree_elf_border_story_pt1;The Aen Seidhe, the People of the Hills. Traces of their magnificence remain visible to this day. Palace ruins still hidden in dense forests, mysterious towers standing atop mountain peaks, sculptures carved from marble white as fresh snow. But the elves themselves? Their numbers continue to dwindle.
reward_tree_elf_border_story_pt2;Their decline rests in the fact that, although the Aen Seidhe surpass humans in longevity, magical aptitude, and knowledge of the natural world, they are at a disadvantage in one important regard – fertility.
reward_tree_elf_border_story_pt3;Although elves can live for centuries, they can only conceive children during their youngest years. Even then, only one out of every two or three couples will successfully bear a child. Humans, on the other hand – well... They seem to have mastered the process.
reward_tree_elf_border_story_pt4;Consequently, though the elves had at first defeated the humans time and time again, they quickly realized that ultimate victory would prove impossible. For whenever they killed one man, another five stood ready to take his place.

reward_tree_emhyr_chest_1;Emhyr var Emreis was prepared to do anything for the sake of power. Spark a war. Kill his own wife. Hurt his own daughter. All without raising his voice, without shedding a tear. His cold eyes never betrayed a glimmer of emotion. They say even the golems who serve in the Imperial Army have more heart than he...
reward_tree_emhyr_chest_2;According to royal biographers, Emhyr had, in fact, grown up a bright and cheerful lad, the apple of his father's eye. But then a coup gripped the Imperial court. The conspirators attempted to coerce Fergus var Emreis to cooperate by torturing his son in front of his very eyes. Unsuccessful, the Usurper enlisted the help of a mage, Braathens, who would transform Emhyr into a freakish, hedgehog-like man-beast. Steadfast and unflinching in the face of his son's hideous curse, the plotters had no recourse but to assassinate Fergus.
reward_tree_emhyr_chest_3;For many years Emhyr plotted his revenge. At first overwhelmed with pain and fury, he howled his throat raw, ripped hair from head, clawed at his own flesh until caked in blood. But in time  his temper cooled and he began to analyze, to calculate. Upon regaining the Imperial throne, Emhyr coldly condemned his father's conspirators to death. He watched their executions in full, then stood without a word and returned to work.
reward_tree_emhyr_story_pt1;Emhyr var Emreis, the White Flame Dancing on the Graves of his Foes. No other name arouses such fear in the hearts of Nordlings. It was during his reign Nilfgaardian forces crossed the Yaruga into the North for the first time... And the second... Oh, and the third...
reward_tree_emhyr_story_pt2;What motivated Emhyr var Emreis? Historians have long debated it. Some have argued he bent to the will of merchants and traders. Others – that he sought new, fertile lands for Nilfgaardian settlement. But what was the truth?

reward_tree_ep5_eithne_story_pt_1;As is well known, Eithné, the one called Silver-Eyed, ruled over the dryads of Brokilon. From the hidden sanctum of Duén Canell, she watched and protected that which was most important: the forest and all who lived there. Without any compromise, it would seem. But in the days long forgotten, Eithné would parley with human envoys, listen to what the distant kings had to say, and if need be, settle with them to ensure peace was retained.
reward_tree_ep5_eithne_story_pt_2;Over time, humans grew bolder, and their demand for timber and lust for long-lost treasure brought them deeper into Brokilon⁠—into direct conflict with the dryads. This led to a war between the two races; a war that would see Eithné's daughter, Morénn, slaughtered and mutilated by Kerackian soldiers during the Battle of the Ribbon. Since then, any chance of compromise vanished, and Eithné ensured all human intruders would henceforth be met with an arrow to the head.

reward_tree_ep5_eredin_story_pt1;Before Eredin chased Cirilla to her dimension, he served King Auberon Muircetach as a cavalry commander in Tir ná Lia. For his ruler, with the Red Riders at his side, he regularly hunted the race that originally inhabited the world of Aen Elle. The unicorns. It’s them, who gave the elf his nickname – Sparrowhawk, for he was their hated enemy and an excellent hunter. Both his looks and behavior resembled a dark bird of prey.\nMoreover, when Ciri arrived in the world of Aen Elle, it became clear that Eredin had what Auberon Muircetach had long lacked – strength and determination to act. Thus, it didn’t take long before he decided to poison the old king for the good of his own people.
reward_tree_ep5_eredin_story_pt2;In the distant past, when the Winter Queen was still alive and King Auberon Muircetach had just formed the Red Riders, Eredin had power over Ard Gaeth, the Gates of the Worlds. Thanks to this, he could travel freely to other dimensions, and whenever he did so, he invaded the chosen world ruthlessly. During these raids, his main goal was to find and secure a sufficient number of slaves, preferably humans, who could serve Aen Elle in their world or provide them as a source of power.\nOver time, these events have become a grave legend.

reward_tree_ep5_harald_story_pt_1;Where young Harald lacked in strength and skill, he more than made up for in sheer bullheaded determination. Not one to back down from a fight, regardless of his chances, he would often find himself in unwinnable scraps. Clansmen jested that Harald knew not the difference between bravery and stupidity, and this sentiment was proven true time and again. No more so than when he single-handedly took on a fully-grown bear. Miraculously, Harald survived the bout, but the grizzly behemoth left his leg permanently mangled. From that day on, pain would become both the bane of his life and the boon that propped up his legacy.
reward_tree_ep5_harald_story_pt_2;After the bone in his leg grew back crooked, Harald⁠—forevermore known as "The Cripple"⁠—was plagued by constant agony. Eager to inflict on others the same suffering he had endured, the name "Harald" became synonymous with "pain." All islanders soon learned that fighting The Cripple inevitably led to a brutal end for them and their kin, and would sooner lay down their arms than face his wrath.\n\nHarald's rampage eventually came to an end when he declared himself King of the Isles⁠—his thirst for warmongering finally quenched. This, of course, was only because there was no one left who dared stand in his way.

Lifelong prejudice and a warped sense of justice can blossom from the most inconsequential of moments; what starts as the fluttering of wings becomes a frenzied typhoon. For Jacques de Aldersberg, it was the generosity of a mild-mannered stranger, along with a few words of "wisdom," that led to his favorite childhood game⁠—"Kill the Elf"—and all the horrors that followed.
reward_tree_ep5_jacques_story_pt_2;Perhaps nothing would have come of Jacques' corruption if not for the fact that he was a conduit of powerful source energy. He was subjected to terrible visions of the future from an early age⁠—plagued by premonitions that promised humanity's fall.

reward_tree_ep5_main_story_chest;Human oaths, lofty predictions and all these rubbish regarding destiny, both genuinely amuse and fascinate Gaunter O'Dimm. Oh, especially their Law of Surprise: "You will give me what you already have but which you do not know about yet." And they dare to describe his offers as unclear or not fair? Hilarious, really!\nAfter all, he only opens the eyes of those who wanted to look for themselves. He reveals the madness of the world around them and shows the opportunities that come with it. He navigates the paths that may happen. However, it is up to humans to choose which path they will follow. Will this beautiful woman break the word given by her late husband, or will she keep his oath? Will the warrior lie, cheat, and kill his brothers? Will the old hero save one life, letting thousands die in return? And will the young fool kill thousands to presumably save the world?\nIt’s entirely their choice.\n\nHuman traditions are almost as entertaining to O'Dimm as playing with destiny. Sometimes he even checks himself if they still follow the ancient customs. He wanders around this world, watching as peasants burn their logs for the dead or women tie red ribbons at the cradles to scare off wraiths. As a begging old man, he asks for food, and when the night of Saovine arrives, he waits for people to hide in their cottages from those that have departed this world. Seldomly, those who do not manage to hide or are too drunk for it, get the chance to meet him instead of the dreaded dead. And if they fail to comply with any of his humble requests, showing their disrespect for these ancient traditions, they will see his true face.\n\nBoth monsters and non-humans appear to be resistant to Master Mirror’s influence, or at least they succumb to him less often than humans. It is difficult to say where this comes from, as they can be as greedy, envious, and stupid as any man. Does O’Dimm really have no effect on their souls? Well, it’s possible. However, it sounds too simple to be the whole truth. Looking closely, one could tell that O’Dimm interferes in the affairs of monsters or non-humans, just not directly. For instance, it is enough to subtly aid the right prince in winning the throne, to stoke the flames of hatred, and subsequently turn the lives of thousands of dryads into hell. \nIsn’t it?
reward_tree_ep5_main_story_pt1;For many people, Gaunter O'Dimm is a mystery. Actually for anyone who has had the misfortune to meet him. As a rule Master Mirror doesn’t explain his provenance to anyone unless he wants his interlocutor to live a short and painful life.
reward_tree_ep5_main_story_pt2;For those few who managed to get to know the real name of Master Mirror have long since died – or had something far worse befell them. A simple exploration of his past leads those curious to blindness, with even a short meeting in a crowd changing the fate of man forever.
reward_tree_ep5_main_story_pt3;According to books that can be found in Oxenfurt libraries, Master Mirror is the embodiment of pure Evil, appearing for thousands of years in different cultures, under many different names. Gaunter himself considers this to be a not quite accurate and highly ignorant description of him. He only gives people what they want – he is not to blame for the fact that they want evil and wicked things.
reward_tree_ep5_main_story_pt4;However, one cannot deny at least this: Gaunter O'Dimm is an ages-old creature. He can be found on the edges of the history pages throughout many pivotal events for the Continent. On the other hand, it is difficult to describe his actions as purely evil. Gaunter just reveals secrets selectively, not lying even a bit. He gave a kid a toy to shape his dreams or simply helped a lost man find his way. And he stayed there, hidden in the shadows, to watch what would happen next. Just for his pure amusement.\nYet people often blame him for… For everything, really.\nIt’s simply wondrous, how they’re desperate to believe that gods and other supreme beings control their lives.

That was, of course, until a fellow soldier—one he had never met, no less⁠—nourished the Usurper's umbrage towards the imperator and spurred him to take action before it was too late.

reward_tree_ep6_main_story_pt3;The truth, as it often happens, can be found somewhere in the middle. Alzur was an ambiguous figure. In fact, neither malicious nor benevolent. For he performed both great and vile deeds. Idealistic as well as petty.
reward_tree_ep6_main_story_pt4;Perhaps Alzur's conflicting nature was due to the fact that his actions were largely dictated by… memory. The memory of someone who was completely different from him. A woman who believed in goodness and sacrifice—and ultimately gave her life for it.

reward_tree_ep6_milfgaard_story_chest;The Witcher School of the Viper made their home in the stronghold of Gorthur Gvaed. Guarded by a remarkable tower adorned by a frighteningly ominous spiral coiled around its contours. Yet it held not a candle to the terrifying moat that surrounded it—deep by several hundred feet and truly… breathtaking. No one could tell if what was filling it should still be called water. The smells above the moat were, to put it mildly, hard to forget. Viper witchers, who survived the fall of the stronghold, later joked that it was the stench that led the Usurper’s army to find Gorthur Gvaed.\nCountless soldiers died in this gutter. According to legends, so many perished that one could have made their way to the other side of the moat on a bridge composed entirely of their corpses. And the odour grew even worse.
reward_tree_ep6_milfgaard_story_pt1;Ivar founded the Viper School having a great purpose in mind—contrary to rumours that its sole reason for existence was to offer less savoury services. The grandmaster understood that he would not be able to achieve his true goal alone—he intended to find and defeat the Wild Hunt.
reward_tree_ep6_milfgaard_story_pt2;You see, Ivar was one of the unfortunate few who endured the mutations extremely well, and so was selected for further, more complicated experiments. Of those subjected to these enhancements, only he survived—perhaps due to the mages only managing to partially complete the trial.
reward_tree_ep6_milfgaard_story_pt3;As a result of these experiments, Ivar gained his moniker, as well as a new sight. His so-called “Evil Eye” saw a different world. Many other worlds, really.

The earth broke and terrifying creatures appeared upon the surface, bringing death to everything beautiful in the valley.\nFor the following years, no one dared to go to Dol Dhu Lokke—except for witchers. These were of two kinds. Those who thought they would become famous by finally purging the place of monsters. And those looking for a glorious death. Only the latter achieved their aim.\nIn the end, what the witchers failed to do, was accomplished by hunger. Because predators outnumbered their prey, they lacked food. Therefore, the monsters began to fight among themselves.\nUntil they all killed each other… or starved.
reward_tree_ep6_monsters_story_pt1;The viy was a monster born due to a combination of magic and bad luck. It was created in Maribor by Alzur himself with his infamous Double-Cross. But the spell was not a success. A creature with a serpentine body and a million legs sprang up over the city, then went berserk and began to destroy everything in sight.
reward_tree_ep6_monsters_story_pt2;By the time the viy left Maribor, it had turned about half of the buildings there into ruin. Soon after, the monster—bloated with human flesh—hid in the forests of Riverdell and fell into a deep slumber.

Mages were aware of the destruction it caused in Maribor, yet they had not expected a creature of such enormous size. Neither did they dream of waking it up. The spells they used were intended to bind the viy. Once again, however, the viy proved to be quite resistant to magic.

reward_tree_ep6_nrealms_story_chest;The Witcher School of the Griffin made their home within the walls of the Caer y Seren fortress, or Kaer Seren if you go by the common tongue. This was a prominent fortification due to its location. Not because it stood on the shores of the Great Sea, but because of its vicinity to the Dragon Mountains. As a result, reaching Kaer Seren by land proved too daunting a task for most. The locale also provided the residents of Kaer Seren access to seafaring traders, ensuring they were always well-supplied. Armed with crossbows, a secured position, and a reliable source of provisions, the Griffins remained ready and capable to repel any assault.\nNevertheless, not a single soldier was employed in Kaer Seren’s destruction.\nUsing the very mountains that had long protected the Griffins, the Council of Mages turned the tables—unleashing a devastating avalanche… burying them alive. Only Keldar survived.\nThe old mentor still guards the ruined fortress of his beloved school.

reward_tree_ep6_nrealms_story_pt2;Nevertheless, the master of the Griffin School sincerely believed in the same values ​​that Alzur professed. Like the mage, he knew "The Guide to Chivalric Virtues" by heart, and could recite any passage from the book at a moment's notice. Erland even learned fencing from one of the great-grandchildren of its author. In a sense, he became a knight before he became a witcher.
reward_tree_ep6_nrealms_story_pt3;This was one of the reasons why Erland founded his own school—to guide witchers toward more noble virtues, in hopes of changing how the common folk perceived them. Perhaps one day, he envisioned, they would stop fearing the monster slayers and instead show respect and gratitude.
reward_tree_ep6_nrealms_story_pt4;Erland of Larvik also conceived a future where Griffins would not have to charge anybody for their services. To this end, once he made his name famous, the witcher began to visit royal courts in an attempt to persuade rulers to donate to his cause.

Over the years, there were numerous hiding places in which witchers subjected their adepts to mutations. They created numerous camps where they trained together. Nevertheless, the founder of the Cats was indeed “created” in Stygga Castle, and thus—it was their first home.\nNot for long, however.\nIn rebellion against those who created them, young Gezras led other witchers to escape the castle. Needless to say, they had to earn their freedom by force. After the painful experiments they were subjected to, many were more than eager to bleed the mages that had wronged them.\nLater, the Cats grew stronger, bolstering their ranks with badly mutated witchers who had been rejected by other schools. The outcasts gathered together to raise the next generations through corrupt experimental methods. Over time, their warped mutations and aggressive disposition earned them the disdain of other schools.
reward_tree_ep6_scoiatael_story_pt1;Gezras, born a half-elf, was considered an abomination and sold to the mages of Stygga castle at a very young age. His mutations were part of a new process designed to dull the emotions of would-be witchers even more than usual. The new recipe, however, failed... spectacularly so. Instead of inhibiting emotions, the method⁠—quite ironically⁠—enhanced them, leaving Gezras and his new brothers permanently unhinged and prone to erratic behaviour.
reward_tree_ep6_scoiatael_story_pt2;More concerned with discovering the source of their error than the well-being of their test subjects, the mages caged their spoiled batch with the determination to dissect until a solution could be derived.

reward_tree_ep6_skellige_story_chest;The Witcher School of the Bear made their home within the frigid halls of Haern Caduch—a remote fortress nestled within the peaks of the Amell mountains. Survival within its unwelcoming walls proved a constant challenge, particularly for the younger adepts. If one wasn’t huddled by the warmth of the hearth to stave off frostbite or scrambling under pelts to stave off hypothermia, there was always the never-ending removal of snow from the courtyard… It is no wonder Bear Witchers have shown extraordinary endurance—even when compared to their peers. \nEventually, many believe due to their glacial dispositions, surrounding villages banded together, agreed they would rather share the mountain with the monsters than the witchers, and marched on the keep. Having little to no bonds of brotherhood amongst themselves, they decided to part ways with both Haern Caduch and each other rather than partake in a meaningless slaughter.\nThe stronghold itself remains relatively intact to this day, albeit hidden under an ever increasingly thick layer of snow.
reward_tree_ep6_skellige_story_pt1;Arnaghad, some would say, was born stubborn. Insolent toward those in authority, he loathed anyone who tried to impose their will upon him, favouring autonomy above all else. This, in large, was the bedrock of why he went on to form his very own witcher school.
reward_tree_ep6_skellige_story_pt2;While other witchers saw in themselves a duty—a purpose that transcended mere necessity⁠—Arnaghad perceived their work as nothing more than that: work. A witcher was to take contracts, kill monsters, and collect coin⁠—anything else, he would argue, was just inflated nonsense to feed the ego.
reward_tree_ep6_skellige_story_pt3;Not wanting to be a slave to a code he did not believe in, he gathered a handful of likeminded witchers and ventured to the Amell mountains, settling into a fortress amid the icy slopes and established the Bear School; a place where would-be witchers could be taught the practicalities of their trade, without the distraction of "honourable virtues" impeding their training.
reward_tree_ep6_skellige_story_pt4;Ironically, it was the fundamentals of Arnaghad's school that ultimately led to its dereliction. For the Bear witchers, without sentiment or brotherly comradery to bind them, eventually went their separate ways, seeing no practical reason to stay loyal to each other or the master of their school.

It contained both the laboratories, where they produced fisstech and conducted their experiments, as well as sleeping quarters for all members. Thanks to this, the production of fisstech did not stop even for a moment. The alchemists worked on the drug tirelessly, day and night. The whole operation was managed by Gellert Bleinheim in cooperation with his brother Roland, who supplied the hideout with beggartick blossoms.\nAs for the experiments… The Salamandra mages worked ever-so-tirelessly—using stolen mutagens⁠—to create something far worse than narcotics.\nOf course, until a certain white-haired witcher decided to pay Salamandra a visit...

reward_tree_ep7_ep7_main_chest_1;If absolute power corrupts absolutely, then reason can be found in the anxiety surrounding the subject of magic. For thousands of years, those craving power have used the mystical energy as a core component to their dastardly deeds. From Nilfgaard's abuse of outlawed necromancy and alchemical warfare to the twisted sacrificial rites of the Skellige Isles, Chaos has constantly been exploited without constraint. Indeed, one need only look briefly at the dark side of magic's history to understand the contempt held by many toward it.
reward_tree_ep7_ep7_main_chest_2;It was long before Radovid V's reign when the prejudice toward mages first reared its ugly head. Wanting to paint the whole practice in a negative light, a clutch of iconoclasts started to refer to magic as witchcraft, drawing particular attention to the deeds of the corrupt few. Soon, stories of wicked witches and their sinister schemes spread far and wide, vilifying all those who used sorcery⁠—both good and bad⁠—and stoking the flames of widespread persecution. From commoners to aristocrats, folk started regarding magic as a defilement of the natural order, with all those wielding it seen as conceited wretches, deviant and depraved. Soon after, the general perception of magic shifted quite violently, witch hunts became commonplace, and pyres began to burn brightly across the Continent, consuming the guilty and innocent alike.
reward_tree_ep7_ep7_main_chest_3;Over the years, the persecution of mages gave birth to many independent contractors specialized in rooting out and punishing all magic users. Radovid's army of Witch Hunters aside, none were known to have been more successful than Octavia Hale—the self-proclaimed "Witchfinder"⁠—and her steadfast sons, Fabian and Ignatius. The Hales were said to have an unparalleled knack for tracking the scent of witchcraft and tallied up an impressive number of profitable hunts during their active years. In fact, their methods became so dependable that, in taverns across the Northern Realms, it was often jested: if there's yet to be a witch burned in your town, ‘tis only because the Hales have yet to visit.
reward_tree_ep7_ep7_main_story_pt1;When the many worlds of the multiverse aligned, it is said that potent magic, quite unlike anything yet known, gushed forth into existence from various magical Planes. Merging with the energy already present, it embedded itself deep within all matter, forever altering the shape of our reality and the future of the world.
reward_tree_ep7_ep7_main_story_pt2;The Elemental Planes from which it came are said to contain strange beings formed from powerful magical energy. It is widely accepted that these domains⁠—and the beings⁠ within—are the source of all magic, with each of them possessing its own fundamental Element.
reward_tree_ep7_ep7_main_story_pt3;These Prime Elements comprise Air, Earth, Fire, and Water, with each embodying unique properties and requiring varying levels of proficiency to control. In addition to these fundamentals, there is a fifth, more complex essence known as Ether, which derives from the mysterious Astral Plane and is used in such magics as teleportation and suppression.
reward_tree_ep7_ep7_main_story_pt4;Those with an aptitude for magic can, with enough dedication, learn how to draw energy from each Plane, usually achieving efficiency in only one of the Elements. In the Continent’s history, it is said only a single mage has ever been able to master all four Primary Elements, illustrating the determination and talent required for such a feat. No one, however, has yet mastered all five.⁠
reward_tree_ep7_francesca_chest_1;Francesca abhorred her father’s reluctance to meet the dh’oine on the field of battle. She saw his isolation from external affairs as a cowardly act, and one that spat in the face of all elves wishing to live free from persecution. But despite her incessant beseeching, Simlas refused to send his subjects to their slaughter and forbid his daughter from getting involved. Alas, his words fell on deaf ears. Inspired by the infectious rhetoric of the warrior elf Aelirenn, Francesca defied her father’s orders, mustered her kin, and joined the rebellion.
reward_tree_ep7_francesca_chest_2;Simlas' forlorn prophecy came to be. The rebellion was short-lived, and in the wake of human conquest lay a generation of elves thoroughly suppressed and mercilessly slaughtered. Francesca was lucky enough to survive the doomed venture, yet her brash nature had cost her much. Most of her companions were dead, and the future potential of her race all but obliterated. In addition, her father, enraged by her betrayal, disowned her, vowing that words would never break between them again⁠—a promise he would keep until the end of his days.
reward_tree_ep7_francesca_chest_3;There was a time when Francesca’s decisions were guided by fiery impulse, governed by a desire to act swiftly in place of calculated tact. A lifetime of mistakes, however, can work wonders in cooling one’s hot-headedness, and slowly but surely, she became the dispassionate tactician her father had once wished her to be. But even he would recoil in horror to witness the pact she later made with the Nilfgaardian Emperor.
reward_tree_ep7_francesca_story_pt1;There was a time in Francesca Findabair’s life when she did not even remotely consider the advantages of diplomatic tact. She believed direct action was the best way to ensure survival, especially when regarding humans⁠—a race renowned for their lustful expanse and underhanded methods.
reward_tree_ep7_francesca_story_pt2;When speaking of these oppressive foreigners, she frequently quoted her father, the elven Sage Simlas Finn aep Dabairr, regurgitating the words she had often heard during childhood. ‘Only those lacking sense,’ her father would spit with pure contempt, ‘would trust the word of a dh’oine.’
reward_tree_ep7_francesca_story_pt3;Yet, her father had long since changed his tune regarding the humans. Or, at least, altered his pitch. For he had used a magical orb of insight to witness shimmers of the future, and saw that war with the ape-men would only lead to the annihilation of elves.
reward_tree_ep7_francesca_story_pt4;Not wanting to lead his kind to their deaths, Simlas swallowed his pride and entered a peace treaty with the humans, hoping the act would save the elves from massacre.

reward_tree_ep7_shewhoknows_chest_1;The Mother took fondly to being revered as a goddess, encouraging her daughters to stoke the flames of their expanding renown whenever they could. Loyalty was rewarded with insight and magical assistance, and soon most of the peasants of Velen dutifully worshipped the Lady. Besides, it was difficult for non-believers to openly reject the Mother’s benevolence, as such heresy would be considered an insult. This, of course, was an especially dangerous stance to take, as the sisters had established an annual night of celebration dedicated to their mother⁠—and with the celebration came sacrifices of blood. Ironically, it was on one of these nights that the daughters later killed their mother, burying her body deep within the marshes. However, the ancient witch’s soul refused to leave in peace, and so the sisters used dark magic to imprison it within the boughs of a great oak, where it remained for many years, idle and powerless.
reward_tree_ep7_shewhoknows_chest_2;For centuries, the Lady of the Wood’s spirit remained trapped beneath the great oak upon the hillock, crying and wailing in frustration as it wandered eternally through a maze of boughs⁠—a prison within a labyrinth of leaves. Unable to escape from the fetters of magic that held it, the spirit raved, thrashing the gnarly branches of the oak, killing all those who dared approach⁠—men, women, and children alike. One day, a wanderer stumbled upon the hidden cavern beneath the oak and decided to end the curse of the Whispering Hillock⁠—an act that would see the Mother’s ghost finally released from its accursed shackles. To this day, it is often debated as to whether the wanderer released the spirit back into the world or simply destroyed it. Either way, the great oak upon the hillock now stands in calm serenity.
reward_tree_ep7_shewhoknows_chest_3;There are those that say an ancient spirit roams the woodlands of Velen⁠—a gale galloping in the body of a beautiful black steed. Most importantly, it is known among the locals that one should be wary if they happen upon the horse⁠—an ethereal silhouette with red eyes burning bright.⁠ The beast, you see, brings madness. All who get too close to the creature are stricken with a potent mania⁠—an unrelenting drive to do harm most violent to themselves and others. Tales have often been shared of loved ones brutally slaying each other in the wake of meeting the beast, unable to still their frenzied bloodlust. But such things should not be feared, for it is said that the spirit avoids all confrontation, and one would have to go looking quite specifically for the creature to find it. And one with a desire to do such a thing, of course, must already be quite mad.
reward_tree_ep7_shewhoknows_story_pt1;There are many things she knew, and some things only she knew, for the Lady of the Wood was a being as enigmatic as the origin of life itself⁠—and just as old⁠—for her age far exceeded even the most exaggerated legend of her heritage. With this long life came incomprehensible wisdom, but the knowledge gained from such longevity could not be hailed entirely as a blessing, as behind the veil of enlightenment lay discontent, along with a dormant madness waiting to stir...
reward_tree_ep7_shewhoknows_story_pt2;The witch was obsessed with discovering the meaning of existence and journeyed throughout the world in search of answers. For centuries she roamed, soaking up all knowledge until there was no secret left unknown to her. Yet, the more wisdom she amassed, the more hollow and unfulfilled she felt⁠—a cruel conundrum and one she simply could not hope to solve. That is, not until a magnificent cataclysm split reality itself and brought forth strange creatures into the world, along with powerful magic.
reward_tree_ep7_shewhoknows_story_pt3;Even though many new beings had come from the Conjunction, there were still none like herself, and therein, she mused, might lie the answer to her anguish. Perhaps the empty feeling she felt was loneliness, and her search was not a search for enlightenment but for companionship. Thus, using the mystical forces brought by the cataclysm, she mixed her blood with mud and sculpted three beings from the clay—three daughters made in her image, to comfort her and carry forth her legacy.
reward_tree_ep7_shewhoknows_story_pt4;With her daughters, she ruled over a moory land called Velen, worshipped as a goddess by the locals. Yet contentment still eluded her, and soon she spiraled into utter despair. The endless pursuit of purpose had finally broken her, and she was slowly consumed by an insatiable madness. Her mania, augmented by the powers she possessed, gushed forth like a poisoned spring, defiling Velen and infecting all those who lived there. Soon, chaos consumed the land, and it teetered on the precipice of ruin. Thus, the three daughters decided to end their mother’s life and, with it, the all-consuming madness.

In such a scenario, the folk of the Continent would likely haved longed for their former kings – even those considered tyrants and whoresons...
reward_tree_eredin_chest_2;Eredin made great effort to leverage human legends and superstitions. For this reason, his riders wore ghostly armor to appear as specters. What's more, he haunted the waters of Skellige with a ship resembling Naglfar, the mythical drakkar storied to be constructed from the nails of the dead. Due to his fear-mongering tactics, Eredin's Wild Hunt riders rarely had need to draw their weapons. They simply watched as their foes dropped their own...

reward_tree_fancesca_chest_1;According to the provisions of the Cintrian peace agreement, sovereignty of Dol Blathanna would fall to the elves. However, the treaty did not specify in what condition. With this loophole kept well in mind, all those fleeing the valley carried what they could and burned the rest. In place of her beloved Valley of Flowers, Francesca Findabair inherited a Valley of Ashes.
reward_tree_fancesca_chest_2;Francesca sought to return the Valley of Flowers to its former glory, though her aim would prove far more difficult than she had anticipated. Razed palaces can be rebuilt, scorched gardens can be recultivated. Yet after years of exile, the elves had forgotten many of their time-honored traditions and customs, instead soaking in human culture. It seemed Dol Blathanna would never regain its former identity.
reward_tree_fancesca_chest_3;Francesca realized that one false move could once again bring ruin upon the Valley of Flowers. Thus, she patiently tolerated her neighbors' incessant provocation. However, were any to cross the border into Dol Blathanna, Francesca would stop at nothing to defend her realm and subjects.
reward_tree_fancesca_story_pt1;Francesca Findabair, known also by her true name Enid an Gleanna, is widely regarded as the Continent's most beautiful woman – elf or otherwise. Yet she is also its saddest – all due to her dream fulfilled...

reward_tree_filavandrel_chest_1;When the kingdom of elves fell to ruin, Filavandrel found refuge in the Blue Mountains, at the edge of the world, far from human settlements. There, surrounded with rubble and mountain pine, he longed for the day he could return to his beloved Valley of Flowers... And the luxuries with which it overflowed.
reward_tree_filavandrel_chest_2;The White Ships – words belonging to one of Filavandrel's many titles – are a reference to the vessels on which the elves first arrived to the Continent. Yes, yes... The noble Aen Seidhe were not this world's first inhabitants. A fact they are reluctant to admit... Likely because the cruelty they inflicted upon the land's indigenous races bears a striking resemblance to humans' callous treatment of elves several hundred years later.
reward_tree_filavandrel_chest_3;Filavandrel has many reasons to be proud. Among them is the fact that he once belonged to a small group who managed to best the legendary Geralt of Rivia in battle. He stood poised to kill the witcher, but his hand was stayed by the sudden appearance of Dana Méadbh, an elven goddess who abhors bloodshed. Had she not intervened, the fate of the world might have turned out rather differently...

On the contrary, he spoke fluent Elder Speech and was a connoisseur of elven poetry and dwarven ale. Nevertheless, he fought against the Squirrels with unbridled ruthlessness. He sentenced every prisoner of war to the breaking wheel, considered sympathetic humans as spies, and confined all non-humans to segregated city quarters. "After all," he thought, "reasons of state sometimes demand sacrifices."
reward_tree_foltest_chest_2;Foltest claimed dozens of wartime victories – often against overwhelming enemy forces. What was his secret to success? An analytical mind? Swift and decisive action? The king himself used to say that he owed his many victories to an excellent memory. For he knew the names of all his officers – even many of the rank-and-file. He understood their strengths and weaknesses, thus enabling him to assign the right person to any task. As a result, most in Foltest's service considered themselves friends to the king. And all were prepared to give their life for him.
reward_tree_foltest_chest_3;King Foltest was not particularly religious as rulers go. He did not observe fasts nor venture out on pilgrimages. In fact, often without a second thought, he had broken all religious edicts concerning one's private affairs in the alcove. Nevertheless, he spared no expense when it came to erecting new temple and even agreed to a tithe, proving a significant drain on the royal treasury. Yet, to what end? Although he doubted the existence of the gods, he recognized that the power of their priests was very real. Any attempt to limit their influence might provoke their holy wrath...

reward_tree_gernichora_chest_1;Gernichora, as the legend goes, was once a princess on her way to wed one of King Cedric's sons in Vizima when her retinue ran adrift in Angren, engulfed by the treacherous swamps of Ysgith. The princess, at the last possible moment, caught hold of a nearby tree root before the bog's thick mud could swallow her up. Desperate for help, she screamed and screamed, yet there wasn't a soul for miles. Others arrived at her side, however. The princess was quickly overwhelmed by hundreds of leeches that drained her body down to the last drop of blood. Then, enveloped in the mysterious power of Ysgith's swamps, the princess was reborn – a monster.
reward_tree_gernichora_chest_2;Gernichora was, in fact, a post-Conjunction monster whose name derives from the Elder Speech. The elves called her Gvaern Ichaer – the Bloody Mistress. The Aen Seidhe, though incapable of defeating Gernichora, did their best to limit her power. When the last elves left Angren, their warnings fell on deaf ears. It wasn't long before the effects of local ignorance and negligance were felt...
reward_tree_gernichora_chest_3;Many rulers have attempted to harness the power of Ysgith: first the Temerians, followed by the Nilfgaardians. Drawn by its potential, they sent vast settler caravans – heavily guarded, of course – into the tepid swamps. But the end result was always the same: affliction, insanity, and the stench of mass graves to whet the appetite of nearby ghouls. Ysgith largely remains uninhabited, and perhaps that's for the best.
reward_tree_gernichora_story_pt1;Angren is one of the most treacherous regions of the Continent... And Ysgith is the most dangerous locale within Angren. It is there one can find the lair of the horrifying monstrosity known to locals as Gernichora.
reward_tree_gernichora_story_pt2;According to some, Gernichora appears as a tall woman, covered head to toe in blood-gorged leeches. Others claim she resembles a siren, though with the abdomen of a leech in place of a fish tail. The debate is likely to rage on, however, as no one who's had the pleasure to examine the beast firsthand has ever returned alive.
reward_tree_gernichora_story_pt3;Nevertheless, the inhabitant of Angren's marshes are well-acquainted with her most iconic trait: the fruits of Ysgith. From afar they appear to be thirst-quenching apples – so plump, red, and juicy that the branches bend under their weight... Yet whenever a wayward traveler—delirious with hunger—reaches for one, he grabs naught but an enormous leech, engorged on blood near to the point of bursting.
reward_tree_gernichora_story_pt4;Gernichora's not wholly unlike a vampire, though rather than feast on the blood of others, she feeds them with her own.

After imprisoning the witcher using a paralyzing spell, he proceeded with mad and reckless experiments to free his son from the witcher’s mutations. Utterly ignoring his son’s contrary pleas for mercy.\nThis process was not mild. Not at all.\nBrought to the brink of death on many occasions, he rose every time faster and stronger than before.

The Wolf School's mentors believed a depiction of George's triumph over a dragon would prove a valuable point of study for their witchers-in-training. By facing the scaly foe alone, the witcher demonstrated great courage. Yet, in the bitter end, George's misguided faith in the virtues of men served as a tale of caution for the future monster slayers. Alas, the fresco of the famed dragonslayer was treated by the young Wolves as little more than a open canvas on which to sketch curly mustaches, bushy beards, and other features of the male anatomy...
reward_tree_griffin_avatar_story_pt1;Word has circled far and wide that witchers refuse to accept contracts on dragons as the scaled behemoths are not only sentient, but highly intelligent beings. Indeed, the Continent's most famous monster slayer, Geralt of Rivia, closely adhered to this principle. Yet, his brother-in-arms from the Griffin School, George of Kagen, followed no such tenet...
reward_tree_griffin_avatar_story_pt2;Witchers and experienced blacksmiths alike highly prized the School of the Griffin's exceptionally durable armor. Perhaps to a fault.

Alas, the peasant's wishes for a brighter future outshined this gesture of goodwill.

Then one day, lured by the promise of ample reward, a mysterious man appeared at Papebrock's court to offer an enormous egg of nearly five pounds – an egg he claimed to have plucked from a griffin's nest. In three weeks' time, a strange creature finally emerged from that egg, though a griffin it certainly was not. It resembled a great goose with powerful, naked legs and a long, flimsy neck. The beast never did allow Valerian to ride atop its back, though its succulent meat did become a topic of great conversation and a point of pride for the Papebrock family at their next banquet.
reward_tree_griffin_border_story_pt1;In the past, griffins were known to limit their territory to the high mountains where they hunted marmots and goats. However, in more recent memory, the hybrid monsters extended their range to the plains, for they had learned that sheep were less nimble prey. And their shepherds even more so...
reward_tree_griffin_border_story_pt2;It is common knowledge that griffins pair for life and will defend their mates at any cost. For this reason, they often serve as a symbol for courage, loyalty, and valor.
reward_tree_griffin_border_story_pt3;It should come as no surprise, then, that the griffin appears on many coats of arms across much of the Continent, such as in the Kingdom of Caingorn and in families such as the Papebrocks of Temeria. In fact, the beast's admirable traits are so well respected that the monster even became the symbol for a school of monster slayers...
reward_tree_griffin_border_story_pt4;Little is known about the School of the Griffin. Its precise location remains unknown and only three witchers from the school have been recorded in the annals of the Continent's history: George of Kagen, Jerome Moreau, and a third, unnamed witcher who reportedly fell to the blade of Leo Bonhart.

reward_tree_gudrun_chest_1;The pirates under Gudrun's command learned quickly that the hooks they'd long used for boarding ships would perform equally well on the multistory buildings of Novigrad. Nowadays, whenever prudent Novigradians hear something clank and scrape across their roofs, they quickly gather their most valuable possessions and hurry to lock themselves in the cellar.
reward_tree_gudrun_chest_2;On the Skellige Isles, women and men stand on equal footing. Both learn the arts of war and seafaring. Despite this widespread knowledge of Skellige's customs, many mainland folk give a snort and a wink at the sight of Skellige's warrior women, thinking their weapons serve merely as decorative trinkets. Gudrun has always relished opportunities to personally educate folk on the consequences of their ignorance.
reward_tree_gudrun_chest_3;Many Novigradians have tried to woo the beauteous pirate's heart with exquisite floral bouquets and romantic ballads. Despite these persistent efforts, Gudrun always firmly rejected their advances, for her heart had belonged to someone else...
reward_tree_gudrun_story_pt1;Gudrun had once been a terror of the Great Sea. At the mere sight of her dreaded longship, the Flyndr, merchant vessels would hoist their white flags of surrender without a moment's delay.
reward_tree_gudrun_story_pt2;That is, until the day the cutthroat Skelliger decided to offload her bounty in Novigrad... Then resolved to settle there forever.

reward_tree_harald_chest_1;Harald an Craite was easy to spot on the battlefield due, in part, to his limp. Perhaps more noticeable, however, was his iconic helmet decorated with ram horns. Apparently, this one piece of armor weighed nearly two stones. When asked if such a helmet was practical, Harald answered simply, "If you don't train your neck, sooner or later it'll bend to someone." Though his actual language was much more... colorful.
reward_tree_harald_chest_2;Harald's hair greyed at a young age – a consequence of his visit to the Cave of Dreams. The cavern is known to Skelligers as a mystical place that confronts you with your greatest fear. What Harald witnessed in those caves, no one knows for certain... But some close to the king claimed he saw himself.
reward_tree_harald_chest_3;Harald never wielded a shield in battle. He entered the fray only ever with a sword in one hand and a bloodred banner in the other. He was of the mind that shields offer a false sense of safety and security. Indeed, Harald believed battle could be reduced to a single, fundamental choice – charge or die.
reward_tree_harald_story_pt1;At an early point in his life, Harald was merely a warrior of average skill. That is, until a bear shattered his leg – an injury that never healed properly. He was left with an intense, lingering pain for the remainder of his days... Yet, since that fateful day, he fought more ferociously than ever before.
reward_tree_harald_story_pt2;Perhaps because he endured constant pain, day and night, he understood it better than any other ever could. His capacity to inflict suffering likewise grew, for he knew precisely where to strike and how to cause the greatest agony imaginable.
reward_tree_harald_story_pt3;Harald had a notorious reputation among many on the Isles. Not because he plundered and murdered, for any self-respecting Skelliger would often do the same. But rather because he did not give his foes a chance to receive an honorable death. Unrelentingly, he inflicted horrible suffering until they squirmed in pain at his feet, begging him pathetically for mercy.
reward_tree_harald_story_pt4;After Harald eventually fell in battle, pierced by an arrow, he was honored with a lavish funeral. The rite lasted three days and nights, and when the longship with his remains was finally engulfed in flame, everyone breathed a deep sigh of relief...

reward_tree_hemmelfart_chest_1;As Hierarch of the Church of the Eternal Fire, Cyrus Hemmelfart is a man of great power and the knowledge of how to wield it. Absolutions, excommunications, indulgences... they are, all of them, excellent tools for applying pressure on allies and foes alike.
reward_tree_hemmelfart_chest_2;Hemmelfart quickly ascended to the peak of the Church's hierarchy and equally quickly became accustomed to the privileges that accompany the position. He adorns himself in silks and satins, drinks rare wines from silver chalices, partakes only of the most sumptuous fare and, discreetly of course, keeps many supple bodies to warm him in his bed...
reward_tree_hemmelfart_chest_3;Many Novigradians often wonder whether the Church of the Eternal Fire's chief ideologue himself even believes in the faith's doctrine. Does he truly believe a new and better world will rise from the ashes of righteous flame? Of course, not a soul would ever utter these questions in public, for they know that those who do find themselves branded heretics and burned alive atop a pyre...

reward_tree_henselt_chest_1;Fate has a twisted sense of humor and Henselt was one of its many victims. The King of Kaedwen often enjoyed boasting of his virility. Following several mugs of stout, he once proudly whispered to a confidant that he had fathered enough bastard children to fill all the thrones of the North – perhaps even several Nilfgaardian provinces. However, after his only legitimate heir died on a hunting expedition, the king failed to beget another successor to the throne – despite his many attempts. Some say it was Henselt's failures in the royal bedchambers that contributed to his explosive temperament...
reward_tree_henselt_chest_2;Henselt did not have kingly countenance. Beady, wandering eyes. A bulbous, red nose. A large, bushy beard... Such a description better suits a bandit than one of the North's most prominent monarchs. Aware of less-than-noble visage, Henselt carefully curated his grand and stately attire, always taking care to bear the royal insignia. He wore an immense belt adorned with silver towers, a fifteen-ounce chain of solid gold, a crown topped with the royal unicorn, and a crimson kaftan exquisitely trimmed with weasel fur. But, as King Foltest used to say with a smile on his face, "A hog festooned with gold remains a hog all the same."
reward_tree_henselt_chest_3;Henselt long refused to accept mages and sorceresses into his court. Though, in the end, he eventually included Sabrina Glevissig among his advisors, albeit not as a source of advice, but as yet another symbol of power – much like an ermine coat or golden scepter. Her role in the Kaedweni court was of the cosmetic variety. However, Sabrina refused to stay silent – sometimes silencing her king with a shout or by pounding her fists on the table. In time, she earned Henselt's recognition, but never forgot about the insults and disdain that first greeted her. Years later, when the opportunity struck, Sabrina betrayed the king... An offense for which she paid the ultimate price.
reward_tree_henselt_story_pt1;King Henselt did not inspire awe with his bandit-like countenance. He did not dazzle ballroom crowds with charisma. He did not impress courtiers with refinement... Yet on the battlefield, one could see a master at work.
reward_tree_henselt_story_pt2;Henselt was capable of determining a catapult's range down to an inch. He walked amongst his siege machines not unlike a proud father – affectionately patting the stones, plucking at the taut ropes as would a troubador with his harp...
reward_tree_henselt_story_pt3;Worse was when his attention shifted away from matters of war, for Henselt preferred the company of his siege machines to that of man. He was quick to anger... But not quick to calm.
reward_tree_henselt_story_pt4;As a result, despite his undisputed talent on the battlefield, Kaedwen's power did not grow under Henselt's leadership. He failed to gain allies and turn his military victories into lasting successes. Though this did not bother the king, as he waged war for its own sake.

Tales of what she did to the young prince make one's blood run cold. How much truth there is to these stories, no one knows.

reward_tree_junior_chest_1;Scholars, philosophers, and religious figures have debated since the dawn of time what can cause a man to become evil. His nature, his upbringing, perhaps black magic or poisons? In Whoreson Junior's case, it was a thick leather belt which his father lashed at him for any reason at all... And sometimes even in the absence of one. Years of fear, pain and humiliation scarred the young Cyprian Wiley. Horrible years for which the people of Novigrad must now pay the price.
reward_tree_junior_chest_2;Whoreson's lackeys wear masquerade masks and jester hats with bells, and paint themselves with grotesque, clownish smiles. Newcomers to the city often mistake them for entertainers and approach closer to indulge in a show or a laugh. Such a blunders have cost many travelers their coin... As well as many of their lives.
reward_tree_junior_chest_3;Perhaps Whoreson's most dangerous trait is his unpredictability. One moment he flashes his toothy grin and pats you on the back, then in the next you'll feel his dagger lodged between your ribs. Why? Because of politics, animosity, or coin?

reward_tree_king_chest_1;The enclave in Novigrad from which the King of Beggars conducts his business is called the Putrid Grove – a small district of muddy, fetid streets where city guards dare not venture. Though it is at their loss, for hidden in the Grove's derelict structures are many sought-after alchemists, mages, and sorceresses destined for penance by fire.
reward_tree_king_chest_2;The King of Beggars, despite his lofty title, makes no use of traditional symbols for wealth and power. He wears humble garb and conceals his face under a hood.

reward_tree_leszy_chest_1;In some regions of the world, cults are formed around leshens. They are offered sacrifices, usually in the form of hares and birds, but sometimes human blood. Many legends have emerged of benevelont leshens that help hunters find prey, guide wayward travelers to safety, even rescue folk from bandit raids. Unfortunately, not a shred of truth can be found in such myths. In fact, leshes see humans as just another source of energy – a source for which their appetites continue to grow.
reward_tree_leszy_chest_2;For years, scholars have debated the true nature of leshens. Although most bestiaries categorize them as relicts, many experts question this classification. Some consider them a being born of black magic, perhaps even necromancy. Others contend that they are demons, akin to djinns or draugs. Autopsies of leshen corpses would undoubtedly shed light on the dispute. However, once slain, its body vanishes... All that remains is of the creature is a yellowed deer skull...
reward_tree_leszy_chest_3;What should one do upon encountering a leshen? Fighting it is out of the question – unless you are an experienced witcher, of course. Naturally, the first instinct would be to flee. Unfortunately, leshens can move between trees at the speed of the wind, making escape nearly impossible. So what is the alternative? Hunters, druids, and elves all agree – any traveler who stumbles upon a leshen should fall to his knees without delay, draw a blade over his wrists, and close his eyes. If fortune smiles upon him, the leshen will be satisfied with the gift of blood and leave the traveler be... And perhaps his wounds can be healed before it is too late.
reward_tree_leszy_story_pt1;Experienced hunters can hide from most dangerous woodland beasts, be they wolves, nekkers, even ekimmaras. But there is no hiding from a leshen.

reward_tree_love_2_story_chest;In 1272, Dandelion and Vespula got back together for a short time, before she once again threw him out on his rear. After her fickle relationship with the bard, love eluded her for many years, and a plethora of dubious men found themselves beneath her balcony, dodging the barrage of "gifts". Finally, Vespula met Silent Yanko, who⁠—as it soon turned out⁠—was deaf. She was smitten and fell in love with him instantly.\nYanko, unlike Dandelion, was a man who really understood her. She just loved talking with him. Or rather, to him.
reward_tree_love_2_story_pt1;Vespula and Dandelion's breakup was the same as their relationship: swift and stormy. As a farewell, the woman gave the troubadour a few parting gifts⁠—a jar of preserve, a chipped pot, a tin cup, and someone else's trousers... She threw them all at him from the heights of her flowery balcony, together with his beloved lute, which Dandelion caught at the last moment before it could smash against the cobbles.
reward_tree_love_2_story_pt2;Vespula did not spare insults against her former lover. She called him a lousy bastard, a devil's son, a lying sloven, and a croaking pheasant. She exclaimed that he was absolutely good for nothing in bed. The whole mess resulted from a simple misunderstanding, and due to Dandelion and Vespula's disagreement on a certain issue: monogamy.
reward_tree_love_2_story_pt3;Geralt witnessed the latter half of this row when he visited Novigrad for a new jacket. Later, after they'd popped in to the Spear Blade tavern to calm Dandelion's nerves, the witcher and the bard ran into Vespula once again. In quite unusual circumstances. A certain doppler had transformed into Dandelion in order to blend in amid the market's crowd. A misunderstanding was inevitable...
reward_tree_love_2_story_pt4;Mimicking Dandelion, the doppler played his lute, grinning at the passing girls. Suddenly, Vespula appeared, still furious and brandishing a sizeable copper pan. Unsuspecting of her intention, the creature greeted Vespula warmly instead of running away, and was promptly bonked over the head. Enticed by the sound of his lute and with a slender step, the real Dandelion appeared on the scene. At the mere sight of the second bard, the terrified Vespula ran away in a fit of panic.\nJust another love story.

reward_tree_love_avatar_chest_1;Dandelion relished any opportunity to mention that he graduated from the prestigious Oxenfurt Academy. That said, he always failed to disclose that a three-year baccalaureate took him nearly a decade to complete due, in part, to three suspensions. What's more, toward the end of his studies, he was also ordered to remain at all times at least one hundred feet from the alchemy department – a rather lenient punishment considering his failed experiments nearly reduced it to cinders...
reward_tree_love_avatar_chest_2;Many who knew Dandelion considered him a licentious rake, among other things. Sigismund Dijkstra, former head of the Redanian intelligence service, once remarked that although the troubadour was aged over forty years, he looked like he was thirty, imagined he was twenty, and behaved like he was ten. To those who knew him best, however, it was apparent that the famous poet was shrewder that he often let on.
reward_tree_love_avatar_chest_3;Though Dandelion was most famous as a poet and a bard, he was quite the jack of all trades. He once owned a tavern in Novigrad, lectured at Oxenfurt, and even tried his hand as an informant. While inspired in small part by a patriotic sense of duty, he ultimately viewed espionage and intrigue as a way to enhance his repertoire of seductive charms. For a time, Dandelion sent reports to the Redanian intelligence service. Granted, their usefulness was questionable, and fact tended to blend with fiction. Contrary to his claims, Dandelion's contributions to intelligence and security proved greatly exaggerated.
reward_tree_love_avatar_story_pt1;Like most artists, Dandelion was deeply moved by beauty. He could be utterly carried away by the mosaic of dancing light on morning dew, the melodious trills of songbirds, and the soft rustling of reeds in a summer's breeze... Though what took his breath away most was that gentle curve leading from slim waist to firm derrière.
reward_tree_love_avatar_story_pt2;Dandelion had dozens, if not hundreds of lovers. Yet one must admit he was unusually egalitarian in his romantic pursuits. Whether revered duchess or humble washerwoman, Dandelion admired all womankind.
reward_tree_love_avatar_story_pt3;On numerous occasions, Dandelion was forced to flee from gentleman caught in a fury, their faces crimson and eyes burning with hatred. At sight of the bard running terrified through the streets, gracious townswomen opened their doors left and right, offering sanctuary... And thus the cycle began anew.
reward_tree_love_avatar_story_pt4;Eventually, Dandelion met his match. After years of flirts, romances, and affairs – with many a broken heart left in his wake – Dandelion discovered the love of his life...

For the price of one crown-filled purse, they could experience a moment of purest ecstasy and intoxication in the arms of their chosen lover ...
reward_tree_love_border_chest_3;There's a saying among witchers: the greater the affection, the greater the affliction. Indeed, many monstrosities are born of love, in some manner at least. Curses cast by spurned lovers can possess incredible power and can bind the souls of their victims even after death, condemning them to roam the world of the living as wraiths...
reward_tree_love_border_story_pt1;It is often said that love knows no bounds. On the Continent, however, the truth is far less poetic. Everyone knows their place. Aristocrats are forbidden to consort with common folk, and humans likewise with elves. Though there is one notable exception to the rule... Belleteyn.

reward_tree_magic_2_chest;The Brotherhood of Sorcerers seized most of the princesses allegedly affected by the Curse of the Black Sun. Stregobor personally performed post-mortem examinations on many, with most deaths during the experiments... None of those experiments brought the expected results. While the princesses had some mutations in their bodies, Stregobor found nothing conclusively proving his claims: they bled like a human, suffered like a human, and died just like a human would.\nYet one escaped his grasp. Renfri, princess of Creyden, also known as the Shrike. For years she was begging, lying, stealing, and even selling herself, just to survive. When she finally grew stronger and had gathered her own group of highwaymen, Renfri began to seek revenge at all costs... In the end, she was prepared to pay the highest price. In order to get her hands on Stregobor, she was ready to slaughter a whole city. A white-haired witcher prevented this from happening, killing not only Renfri, but every member of the Shrike’s crew. Ironically, this act of valiance only netted him the moniker: the Butcher of Blaviken.\nMeanwhile, Stregobor escaped - free of guilt and punishment.
reward_tree_magic_2_story_pt1;Stregobor looked like a wizard plucked straight out of a fairy tale: gray, bearded, hunched, a long staff in hand, and always wearing dark, trailing robes with wide sleeves. One could say: a dignified appearance indeed. But in reality, no self-respecting sorcerer would be caught alive wearing such clothes and accessories. Except for Stregobor, of course.
reward_tree_magic_2_story_pt2;Stregobor was widely renowned for his incredibly realistic illusions. The flowers he conjured smelled sweet, apples could be eaten, bees stung painfully, and beautiful girls did absolutely everything that their creator wanted. It has been said that this last detail was the main motivator for Stregobor’s research into illusions. But the sorcerer himself strongly denied such allegations.
reward_tree_magic_2_story_pt3;Illusions weren’t Stregobor’s only strength. He was also able to calm or create storms, precisely controlling the winds or clouds. However, his greatest passion was poured into researching the Curse of the Black Sun.
reward_tree_magic_2_story_pt4;The Brotherhood of Sorcerers, largely due to Stregobor’s urging, imprisoned in towers and - more or less intentionally - killed dozens of young girls born from royal families. According to the prophecies, exactly sixty princesses were supposed to be possessed by demons, cursed and tainted by the Black Sun. It was written that they will "fill the river valleys with blood". Written - but not proven.\nStregobor’s vials were ultimately the only thing to be filled with blood.

reward_tree_magic_avatar_chest_1;Many accused Yennefer of deceitful behavior. Admittedly, on a number of occasions the sorceress manipulated, twisted the truth, and made habit of quickly switching her allegiances. Yet in the end, it was revealed that she acted on behalf of a higher purpose. That is, on behalf of those she loved.
reward_tree_magic_avatar_chest_2;The childhood of famed sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg was never destined for happiness. The very fact that she was a quadroon – the daughter of a half-elf and a human – meant that she often fell victim to the contempt of her peers. What's more, Yennefer was born a hunchback, which proved reason enough for her own father to disown her – his little girl a monster in his eyes. Though later, as a pupil of Aretuza, she could at long last remove her aesthetic imperfections... Alas, her memories remained as vivid as ever.
reward_tree_magic_avatar_chest_3;Yennefer was a distinguished expert in the magical arts. Yet, unlike her colleagues, she didn't shy away from the darkest corners of magic. If one believes the rumors, Yennefer even dabbled in the strictly forbidden practice of necromancy. However, any criticism was met with a glowering stare and the same, cold reply: "The ends justify the means."
reward_tree_magic_avatar_story_pt1;Mages and sorceresses are individuals who possess incredible power, knowledge and, as is often the case, great ambition. Alas, their aspirations are rarely limited to the forbidden and arcane magical arts. Mages and sorceresses often indulge in political control through the monarchs they advise. For centuries, the most powerful court mages worked behind the scenes, exercising enormous influence on the Continent's political balance. However, everything changed with the ascendance of King Radovid V, the Stern, of Redania. Schools of magic were closed, and countless scrolls were cast into the flames, their contents forever lost to history.
reward_tree_magic_avatar_story_pt2;When King Radovid V began his murderous hunt for mages, Triss Merigold – like many of her colleagues – sought refuge in Novigrad, a neutral city. In place of a haven, however, she and the others found themselves cornered into a trap. Before long, the bodies of magic-wielders began to pile, their lives extinguished by the fanatical priests from the Church of the Eternal Fire. Those few lucky enough to be spared a gruesome death owe their thanks to Triss – not to mention a certain white-haired witcher.
reward_tree_magic_avatar_story_pt3;Yennefer of Vengerberg was a similarly famed sorceress yet, unlike the more amiable and sociable Triss, she followed no path but her own. She joined the Lodge of Sorceresses, true, though not altogether willingly. What's more, the kings she was to advise she instead habitually treated as mere tools in service of her own goals. And Yennefer's lovers, well... She's always enjoyed her playthings.
reward_tree_magic_avatar_story_pt4;Yet all changed for Yennefer when she met Geralt of Rivia with whom her destiny became intimately intertwined. He was the first person she ever truly loved. Though, of course, that did not mean their relationship wasn't without a few bumps in the road...

reward_tree_magic_border_chest_1;The largest institutions for magical training are the Aretuza Academy for young ladies on the Isle of Thanned and the Ban Ard Academy for boys, located in Kaedwen. Why this separation? Contrary to what some believe, it is not because of a difference in magical aptitude between the sexes. Indeed, any differences – should they even exist – are negligible. In fact, academy rectors and instructors simply realized that separating the young lads and lasses would help avoid... distractions.
reward_tree_magic_border_chest_2;Some people are born with an exceptionally potent magical talent – one that often proves difficult to control. Rather than harness its power, they become the vessel for its spontaneous emergence. Through surges of intense emotion – terror, anger, joy – they explode with energy, wreaking havoc in every direction. Such individuals are known as Sources. In some regions of the Continent they are treated with deference and respect – in others, with fear and hatred.
reward_tree_magic_border_chest_3;Mages and sorceresses are individuals with incredible power, knowledge.... And often ambition. Unfortunately, their ambitions are rarely limited to the forbidden and arcane magical arts. Mages indulge in political control through the monarchs they advise. For centuries, the most powerful court mages worked behind the scenes, exercising enormous influence on the Continent's political affairs. However, everything changed with the ascendance of King Radovid V the Stern of Redania. Schools of magic were closed. Countless scrolls were thrown into the flames, their contents forever lost to history...
reward_tree_magic_border_story_pt1;What is magic at its core? Not even mages can come to agreement on the answer. Some see in it a curse, a chaotic and destructive force. Others perceive it as art. Others still view it as science. And every one of them is correct.
reward_tree_magic_border_story_pt2;One's perspective depends the magic's user and their intent. A mage cannot be disentangled from his spells, nor can his intent from the result. Magic is but a prism – a mirror, if you will – through which we look upon ourselves and our world.
reward_tree_magic_border_story_pt3;Magic is all around us. In the air, water, fire and earth. To make contact with it, to draw from it is no challenge at all. Yet, to maintain and control that power... This is an art form few can master.
reward_tree_magic_border_story_pt4;It is these few who may become mages and sorceresses – that is, so long as they attend their respective academies. Masters of the arcane magical arts view the self-taught with disdain, and where possible, swiftly dispose of them.

reward_tree_mahakam_2_story_chest;Agility, keen senses, and a flair for card games weren't the only talents of Percival, and by far the most prominent. The gnome was, above all, an excellent metallurgist and jeweller, and established his first factory in the free city of Novigrad. Having bought a parrot from Zoltan—Field Marshal Duda—he made it a living advertisement, by teaching the bird to call out: "Brrrilliants, brrrrilliants!" And it worked! The gnome had a multitude of customers—his hands were full, and his purse was heavy with coin. With the boom in business, Schuttenbach opened another jewellery branch in Vizima, and the future of his entrepreneurial expansion seemed very bright indeed. Unfortunately, times changed, and not for the better...\nIn 1271, Percival left Novigrad due to racial persecution and moved his factory to Mount Carbon, the capital of Mahakam.
reward_tree_mahakam_2_story_pt1;Though he belonged to Zoltan's dwarven company, Percival Schuttenbach was not a dwarf. Instead of a bushy beard, he had a long, pointed nose that reliably marked the wearer's belonging to the old and noble race of gnomes.
reward_tree_mahakam_2_story_pt2;Percival, giving way to the dwarves in height and strength, was equal to them in endurance. In agility, he was far superior. When he marched with the company, he was always wandering around, rummaging through the bushes, forcing himself forward and disappearing. The gnome would then suddenly reappear, and with nervous gestures, he would signal from a distance that everything was fine⁠—you could go on safely. In other words: Percival was the scout of the team.
reward_tree_mahakam_2_story_pt3;When the gnome and his dwarven companions paused to rest, they would sit by the cart and play Gwent. It was their undisputed favourite card game, to which they devoted every free moment, even on wet evenings. The gameplay was usually loud and violent, with each player having a thick stick close to hand...
reward_tree_mahakam_2_story_pt4;The sticks were rarely used to clobber, but were often waved around threateningly, for some had the bad habit of cheating during Gwent. Percival was one such offender, as he would exchange suggestive blinks with his buddies and hide extra cards here and there. There were times, however, when his beardless face betrayed his deceitful expressions. Once outed as a swindler, he would promptly face a barrage of curses and insults⁠—and stick blows.

reward_tree_mahakam_avatar_chest_1;Though always itching for his next adventure, there was a time when Zoltan considered putting down roots. Unsurprisingly, a woman proved the cause – a lovely she-dwarf by name of Eudora Breckenriggs to be precise. It even went so far as a proposal, followed by a stormy engagement period... That is, until one day when Eudora's father served Zoltan a black stew, signifying an end to his hopes for marriage.
reward_tree_mahakam_avatar_chest_2;Zoltan had an endless stream of novel ideas for enterprise: a foundry, a laundry, an inn, a jeweler's workshop... And one common thread connected them all – each ended with bankruptcy and a torrent of strongly worded letters from outraged investors. Yet no amount of fiascos could convince him to stop trying. Surely, his next venture would at last make him a wealthy dwarf...
reward_tree_mahakam_avatar_chest_3;Zoltan's closest friend was a certain Julian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount of Lettenhove, more commonly known as Dandelion – a celebrated poet of the North. Together, they concocted elaborate business schemes and reveled in drunken debauchery for weeks at a time... Getting themselves into a good deal of trouble along the way.
reward_tree_mahakam_avatar_story_pt1;Mohawk, hearty laugh, fists like bread loaves, and – perched atop his shoulder – a uniquely foul-mouthed parrot. Zoltan Chivay was an adventurer, bouncer, and amateur bird trainer all in one. Truly, a dwarf like no other.
reward_tree_mahakam_avatar_story_pt2;Zoltan felt a deep, burning desire to do good. However, sensible that dwarf he was, Zoltan knew that he alone could not change the world for the better. Instead, he chose to do good only for himself and his immediate surroundings.
reward_tree_mahakam_avatar_story_pt3;Zoltan never hesitated to jump into the fire for his friends... Yet words such as "gods," "honor," and "fatherland" never made a strong impression on him or his motivations. To him they rang hollow, reminiscent of a mug drained of its ale.
reward_tree_mahakam_avatar_story_pt4;Zoltan's position regarding the Scoia'tael could be considered ambivalent. The promise of a better, brighter tomorrow never quite convinced him. That said, he never passed on an opportunity to kick a racist arse or two.

reward_tree_mahakam_border_chest_1;Many young dwarves dreamed of escaping Mahakam for a taste of freedom, in search of adventure. Elder-in-Chief Brouver Hoog was willing to compromise with the youngsters. After a dwarf's fiftieth birthday, he could leave Mahakam to experience human civilization for one year. However, should he not return before 365 days have elapsed, his name should be forever removed from the clan registry. When asked whether he feared that the realm's young dwarves would choose to never return, the Elder-in-Chief gave no response. He simply betrayed a knowing, yet bitter, smirk – for he knew how humans welcomed dwarves.
reward_tree_mahakam_border_chest_2;The dwarves of Mahakam love to revel in song, though almost exclusively in groups. Solo performances are considered the pinnacle of poor manners, yet even they have their place in society. Rival clans often resolve conflicts with yodelling duels. They gather on the slopes of Mount Carbon and vie to out-sing one another with dwarven classics such "Moonshiner Miner" and "Mind the Beard, Long-eared." Unfortunately, such duels often result in avalanches...
reward_tree_mahakam_border_chest_3;The sale of sihils and other fine blades for generations has Mahakam's vaults bursting with riches. Contrary to what most believe, however, ordinary dwarves do not have heavy pockets. Every coin earned from trade goes straight to Brouver Hoog – specifically, to a vault in the deepest levels beneath Mount Carbon. Dwarves receive all of life's necessities from their clan: robes, provisions, tools... Desire something more? Such an attitude won't get you far in Mahakam.
reward_tree_mahakam_border_story_pt1;Mahakam is a land of contradictions. Red-hot forges hidden beneath ice and snow. The Continent's most advanced technology developed by its most conservative society...
reward_tree_mahakam_border_story_pt2;Although wars on the Continent are almost a yearly occurrence, Mahakam maintains its constant neutrality at the crossroads of the borders – a position no kingdom dare challenge, for none wish to provoke the dwarves' ire. Besides, they must purchase their weapons from someone...
reward_tree_mahakam_border_story_pt3;Merchants who travel to Mahakam typically witness but a mere fraction of the dwarven realm's enormity. Much like an iceberg, only a small part of Mahakam is visible above the surface. The real treasures and wonders are found underground, in caverns inaccessible to humans.
reward_tree_mahakam_border_story_pt4;In Mahakam, the dwarves are safe... But not free. Every aspect of their lives is regulated by the Foredwarves' Codex, and every decision must be ratified by the council of clan elders.

reward_tree_meve_chest_1;At first, Meve rarely demonstrated the affections expected of a loving wife. Thus, Reginald sought advice from the noble ladies of his court, who were all in agreement: to win Meve's heart, a gift must be bestowed that would show the depths of the king's love. Alas... Meve proved rather selective. Without a word of explanation, she discarded the finest Ofiri tapestries, flung the sapphire-studded necklaces out the window, and splintered a Koviri lute against her chamber floor. Yet when Reginald presented her a suit of exquisite, gilded plate armor, well... That cold metal melted Meve's heart.
reward_tree_meve_chest_2;Meve possessed many fine qualities: keen insight, breathtaking beauty, and unrivaled bravery. Yet like everyone, she was not without fault. Greatest among them was perhaps her failure to grasp the nature of human weakness. She measured others by the impossible standards she set for herself, and hence quickly bonded with those of equally strong character. Those of a more "sensitive" constitution she held in disfavor – sometimes even contempt. As a result, her relationships with her sons was strained from the very start. This was especially true of her eldest – Villem.
reward_tree_meve_chest_3;Tucked away within the queen's castle in Rivia was a superbly stocked armory, where every manner of exquisite steelwork could be found: elven blades, specially cast Hawker flails... Yet of all the finely tuned instruments of death at her disposal, Meve most highly prized the Mahakam-forged sihil uniquely dubbed the "Sharp Bastard." When asked how the blade acquired such a moniker she merely replied with a heavy sigh. Evidently, the question brought old memories to the fore, both deeply intimate and somber.
reward_tree_meve_story_pt1;Princess Meve was the bane of every royal governess. Rather than knit, she preferred climbing trees. Instead of practicing scales on the harp, she sparred with her brothers using wooden swords. And in lieu of romance novels, she pored over the memoirs of decorated generals.
reward_tree_meve_story_pt2;It was decided that Meve should be married off as soon as possible. Alas, few men of noble birth were willing to ask for the hand of a scrappy sixteen-year-old with scratched knees and bruises every color of the rainbow…
reward_tree_meve_story_pt3;In the end, it was the King of Rivia, Reginald the Courageous, who claimed her hand. Despite not displaying a particularly keen intellect, he proved far wiser than Meve's governesses. Rather than attempt to tame the unruly princess, he simply fell in love with her for who she was.
reward_tree_meve_story_pt4;Sadly, their idyllic union did not last long. Reginald died but a few years later. Neighboring sovereigns presumed the newly widowed Queen would collapse under the weight of the crown; thus, even before the bells of mourning had ceased their tolling, they crossed the border into Rivia. Yet, what awaited the invaders proved a surprise most unpleasant...

reward_tree_monsters_chest_1;Though difficult to envision now, the Continent was once entirely devoid of monsters. However, that changed over one thousand years ago following the Conjunction of the Spheres – the result of a particularly unfortunate alignment of the planets. Worlds once separate began to merge, plunging the Continent into centuries of chaos, soaking the earth in blood.
reward_tree_monsters_chest_2;In time, humans learned to cope with their monstrous new neighbors. They discovered that many beasts are repelled by salt, hence they scattered it in protective barriers. Through trial and error, they learned that a red ribbon worn on the wrist frightens off nekkers, likewise silver with werewolves and vampires. Last but not least, using both magic and alchemy, they created witchers – itinerant monster-slayers for hire.
reward_tree_monsters_chest_3;"Which monster is most dangerous?" A common topic for debate among the Continent's inhabitants. Is it a fiend, whose wither measures 10 feet? A griffin that can shred an armored knight and his mount in one fell swoop? Or perhaps an arachas, whose venom is so poisonous that just one drop can incapacitate an adult man? The truth is that none of these have killed as many people as the common rat, which exposed all of the Northern Kingdoms to the Catriona Plague...
reward_tree_monsters_story_pt1;Humans enjoy marking arbitrary lines on maps, imagining themselves the supreme rulers of the land. Yet, within these borders they draw are forests, swamps, and uninhabited expanses where they dare not venture, for these are still the domains of monsters.
reward_tree_monsters_story_pt2;The Continent is, indeed, home to an astonishing number and variety of monstrosities. Necrophages, relicts, hybrids, draconids... To this day, new species are still being discovered by explorers who, to no great surprise, rarely live long enough to claim a second discovery.
reward_tree_monsters_story_pt3;There is rich diversity among monster species. From mindless, bloodcrazed beasts, such as ghouls, to the frighteningly intelligent, such as higher vampires. From gargantuan fiends to nekker swarms. Yet, they do share a common thread. Humans. Or rather... their appetite for human flesh.
reward_tree_monsters_story_pt4;Yet, it is precisely because of this diversity that humans have been able to maintain some semblance of control over the Continent. But if any force were to unite the monsters of the world, impose a degree of discipline, well... the dominion of man would collapse like a house of cards.

reward_tree_nilfgaard_chest_1;Nilfgaardians interpret loyalty quite differently than the rest of the Continent. For their emperor, they would jump head first into a pool of acid. Yet the moment their leader shows the slightest hint of weakness, it's as if his power turns to smoke and vanishes in the wind. The seat of the Empire cannot allow a mere ounce of incompetence, for due to its vastness and influence, even a minor mistake can lead to far-reaching and unforeseen consequences.
reward_tree_nilfgaard_chest_2;Many believe that Nilfgaard owes its dominance to its superbly equipped legions of heavy infantry. The truth is slightly more complex, however, for Nilfgaard acquires most of its territories without ever declaring war. It often suffices to deploy an assassin to remove the inconvenient leader, then send diplomats to deftly orchestrate the ensuing conflict between his heirs.
reward_tree_nilfgaard_chest_3;In contrast to their squabbling Nordling neighbors, Nilfgaardians have tremendous respect for the law. A court sentence, however unjust, is immediately executed to the letter. Imperial edicts may as well be the word of the gods. As a result, Nilfgaard is incomparably more organized than the kingdoms of the North... And its soldiers execute even the cruelest orders without question.
reward_tree_nilfgaard_story_pt1;Nilfgaard is a nation of extremes. It is the largest, richest, most populated, most powerful and, without a doubt, the most ruthless.
reward_tree_nilfgaard_story_pt2;Nilfgaardians will stop at nothing to defeat their foes. The slaughter of civilians? An unavoidable pity. Poisoning wells? A pragmatic stratagem. Forcing slaves into a suicidal assault? Well... piled corpses work wonders for scaling walls.
reward_tree_nilfgaard_story_pt3;The word "peace" does not exist in the Nilfgaardian language. Ever since chroniclers began keeping records, Nilfgaard has unceasingly conquered, annexed, and vassalized their neighbors. And they won't rest until the Golden Sun shines upon the entire Continent.
reward_tree_nilfgaard_story_pt4;But why this need to conquer? Centuries of armed conflict have made the Nilfgaardian economy entirely dependent on the spoils of war and slave labor. In other words, if the Nilfgaardian war machine ever halted, their society would risk utter collapse. To survive, the Empire must pillage, pillage, pillage...

reward_tree_northern_chest_1;The Northern Realms are bordered by three mountain ranges to the north, east, and south – the Dragon, Blue, and Amell Mountains – and the Great Sea to the west. Yet, what lies beyond these? Nordlings themselves are not quite certain, and to be honest, it's not their most pressing concern. Preoccupied by local disputes, quarrels, and wars, they haven't the time to take interest in foreign lands. Alas, the Nilfgaardian invasion serves as proof that the rest of the world is not of the same mind.
reward_tree_northern_chest_2;What links a town like Vizima, proud capital of Temeria, or Oxenfurt, a center of learning for all the North, with Aedd Gynvael, a provincial settlement at the end of the known world? Nothing, it would seem... After all, each of these places looks, sounds and even smells different. Their origins, however, are identical – all were founded atop ancient elven cities. The ruins sprawling beneath their streets bear witness to this fact. What caused elven civilization to collapse? Plague? Cataclysm? No... Their destruction was wrought by humans.
reward_tree_northern_chest_3;Nordlings often feel conflicted about magic and those who practice it. On the one hand, mages served an undeniably crucial role in the North's defense against Nilfgaard. Yet on the other, their unabashed egotism and tendency to meddle in politics became an irritation to communities and sovereigns alike. The epitome of such arrogance was Philippa Eilhart who, rather than sit content as king's counsel, resolved to take on a leading role herself. This dream would not last, however... And in the end, the flames of pyres raged across the North.
reward_tree_northern_story_pt1;Temeria, Redania, Kaedwen, Aedirn, Kovir, Poviss... There are few who can keep track of the North's many kingdoms and duchies. No sooner had humans seized the land from dwarves and elves than shattered it into dozens of tiny pieces and continued the fight for control amongst each other.
reward_tree_northern_story_pt2;Time and time again, come the thaw of spring, the leaders of the North resumed their petty wars. Temeria attempted to strip Sodden from Cintra. Aedirn and Kaedwen vied for control of the Pontar Valley. Yet, when the black-clad Nilfgaardian legions appeared from the south, they reckoned that, in the end, they stood more united than divided.
reward_tree_northern_story_pt3;When the Nilfgaardian invasion began, most presumed the North would be obliterated in a matter of weeks. Yet, to their great surprise, the outnumbered and underequipped Nordlings managed to repel the Empire's legions.
reward_tree_northern_story_pt4;Had the involvement of mages proved the deciding factor in the North's victory? Or was it the tactical genius of well-trained generals? Perhaps the contributions of Oxenfurt's brilliant inventors? Debates on the topic rage to this day.

reward_tree_oak_story_chest_1;According to legends, the oldest oak in the world is the Great Bleobheris. It sprouted from the Acorn thrown by the waves, long before any humanoid races settled on the Continent. The Bleobheris clearing is a place of frequent rallies, stops for travelers, and meetings of hikers. Druids who look after the ancient tree are happy to host everyone here -- regardless of their status, religion, or race. It was under Bleobheris that the famous bard Dandelion used to sing his ballads.\nUnfortunately, due to the Great Oak's easy access -- and despite the respect it generally commands -- some pranksters have, over the years, carved profanities into the living bark.
reward_tree_oak_story_chest_2;One of the old⁠—but less famous⁠—oaks is the Tree of Tidings of Good and Evil, which grows at the crossroads behind the village of Koprzywnica. The population of the entire area, even those from the distant Spalla, use its huge, rather low branches to hang slats and boards with various announcements on them, including sketches of missing persons, love letters, philosophical arguments, and offers of erotic massage and related services.
reward_tree_oak_story_pt_1;Oaks are exceptional trees. Not only druids but also common folk worship them widely, and the old oak groves are considered sacred throughout the Continent. Whoever starts a fire in one of them will feel the wrath of humans, nonhumans, and gods alike.
reward_tree_oak_story_pt_2;On Ard Skellig, the sacred grove of Gedyneith is not only a place of worship. All major ceremonies are held here, including weddings, funerals, and coronations of rulers. And also -- executions of the worst criminals and traitors.
reward_tree_oak_story_pt_3;In Toussaint, in the heart of the Myrkvid Forest, there is an oak grove. It is an inviolable sanctuary, according to the compacts concluded with the druids by Duchess Anna Henrietta. When the ruler's patronage is not enough to deter intruders, it is usually done by local rumors, as it is said that those who enter druid oak forests are burned alive inside the flaming Wicker Hag.

reward_tree_ofir_chest_1;The first expedition from Ofir was led by Dulla kh'Amanni, or rather the first one that was well documented by historians. There is evidence, however, in the form of Ofiri weapons and decoctions, that suggests a much earlier expedition took place from the land beyond the sea to the Continent. Besides, Dulla's journey would not be as well-known if it weren't for one detail - knowledge and trade were only a cover for the Ofiri's real goal. He was sent by the powerful king Nibras to find the monarch's son who disappeared during his travels to the Northern Kingdoms. Unfortunately, Dulla was not successful. The king was informed of his son's death and Dulla was stuck at the Upper Mill, awaiting further orders. Tired of the rural surroundings, he longed to return to his country.
reward_tree_ofir_chest_2;According to legend, the Crow Mother is the oldest and most powerful of the living flaminicas. She leads a mysterious druid clan in the Gedyneith grove. No one knows, including the druids she leads, whether she is merely a human that can speak crow or the spirit of a crow enchanted into a human body. Or maybe she was a powerful crow deity once, ousted by Freya and eventually forgotten? The theories differ. But there's no doubt that the Crow Mother's followers are not afraid to peer into the darkness or reach for the most poten Ofiri decoctions, as opposed to the more restrained and, according to them, more cowardly druids from other circles.
reward_tree_ofir_chest_3;The Van Moorlehem family is known for their atypical need for slave labor. Apparently, without it, they would not be able to maintain their prestige or their extravagant lifestyle. It's said in the North that a Nilfgaardian aristocrat will not move a finger until a slave does it for him. On the surface, the Van Moorlehems fit in perfectly. Only on the surface, though, because it's hard to find a servant at their palace. It could be said that after the showy parties, regularly and gladly organized by Ophelie Van Moorlehem - Vincent's wife, the ruler of his heart and co-owner of their fortune - their residence stands practically empty. If, however, a slave happens to somehow wander around the palace grounds, the heir to the dynasty, Philippe Van Moorlehem, takes them for a trip to the woods from where they never come back. Hence the family's high demand for "fresh blood"... They'd also like to try the slaves from Ofir, as long as they bleed as readily as the others.
reward_tree_ofir_story_pt1;The only things a typical Nordling knows about Ofir is what he hears in rumors, so a lot of nonsense and not a whole lot of truth. But most rumor-mongers agree on several points…
reward_tree_ofir_story_pt2;First of all, Ofir's located somewhere at the end of the world, far beyond the seas. Second of all, there are no normal animals there. The horses are either white with black stripes or mean and hunchbacked, while cattle have tails growing out of their faces instead of their rears.
reward_tree_ofir_story_pt3;It's surprising, then, that the Ofiri merchants look like normal human beings - they have one head each, as many limbs as they should and behinds in the right places. Still, they haggle like fiends and create wonders like no Nordling can.
reward_tree_ofir_story_pt4;In the eyes of the Ofiri, the inhabitants of the Northern Kingdoms are simple barbarians. Even the famously progressive Nilfgaardians seem like a largely backward nation to them. Unfortunately, ambushes by the Scoia'tael and the numerous hardships encountered by merchants on their journeys across the Continent only reinforce that viewpoint.

reward_tree_scoiatael_chest_1;The Scoia'tael's identifying symbol is a squirrel tail pinned to the belt or cap. Perhaps it has something to do their nimbleness and agility in the forest. If not, then their decision to use this particular rodent is indeed puzzling. Not least because in the regions with the greatest Scoia'tael presence, squirrels are on the brink of extinction. Oh, the irony...
reward_tree_scoiatael_chest_2;The Scoia'tael do not employ the rigid hierarchy of traditional armies. The partisans are divided into groups called commandos, each usually about a dozen strong. The unit's commander is typically a warrior who has displayed exceptional bravery... As well as extreme cruelty toward humans.
reward_tree_scoiatael_chest_3;It is worth emphasizing that not every non-human supports the Scoia'tael. Many perceive the partisans as shortsighted, naive rebels who likely do more harm than good. The sharpest criticisms of the Squirrels, interestingly enough, came from none other than Brouver Hoog... Characteristically ignorant to the nuances of non-human affairs, most humans nevertheless lump them all into the same group.
reward_tree_scoiatael_story_pt1;Not many on the Continent understand Elder Speech – the language of the elves and dwarves. That said, all are familiar with the word "Scoia'tael," or Squirrels – warriors who fight for the rights of non-humans... And don't shy away from cruelty...

reward_tree_scoiatael_story_pt3;As devoted allies of Nilfgaard, no mission for the Scoia'tael was too risky – no sacrifice too great. Yet when it turned out the Empire had overestimated their own might and were forced to seek peace with the Northern Kingdoms, the newborn alliance quickly began to unravel...
reward_tree_scoiatael_story_pt4;Betrayed by Nilfgaard, despised by the Northern Realms, the Scoia'tael were in no position to achieve victory. Yet, by no measure did this mean they would surrender. Overcome with hatred, they continue to fight – not for victory, but vengeance.

reward_tree_sigi_chest_1;Sigismund Dijkstra was man of razor-sharp intellect and great ambition who arose from common origins to become the head of Redanian Intelligence. Alas, betrayal later forced his retreat from the Regency Council and the kingdom. This setback, however, merely served to open another door for one as shrewd and enterprising as he. Seeing the great potential in Novigrad's criminal underworld, he entrenched himself under the alias Sigi Reuven and quickly garnered tremendous influence. And it was he who introduced to the Free City's underbelly a code of conduct – an arrangement to be used to his benefit whenever the opportunity presented itself.

reward_tree_skellige_chest_1;In the Skellige Isles' rich pantheon of gods, the most prominent place belongs to Freya –  goddess of love, fertility, hearth, and harvest. Many consider her the same deity as the beloved Melitele, who is worshipped on the mainland. Though this is best left unsaid on the islands, for Skelligers would consider such a comparison as sacrilege. Freya is also the patron goddess of soothsayers, seers, and telepaths, a fact demonstrated by her associated symbols: a cat who sees and hears what is hidden; a falcon that observes from high above, and Brisingamen – the prophetic necklace of legend.
reward_tree_skellige_chest_2;The Skellige Isles are home to seven clans: Brokvar, Dimun, an Craite, Drummond, Tordarroch, Heymaey and Tuirseach. Members from each considers themselves to be the strongest and the bravest – and any would eagerly duel those who dare question their might. That said, Skelligers recognize authority over the Isles in one king, chosen by popular vote. And who is eligible to have their name considered? Any and all – regardless of sex, age, or lineage.
reward_tree_skellige_chest_3;Skelligers are more closely bound to nature than most on the Continent. Nowhere else do druids command so much respect as in Skellige. Nowhere else do hunters treat animals with such regard. In no other army's ranks do bears roar with such ferocity.
reward_tree_skellige_story_pt1;A smattering of rocks jutting out of the sea, with more sheep than people. At first glance, just a collection of drunkards, unruly shepherds, and rowdy fishermen. Never had a nation seemed so easy to conquer. Or so thought many a leader on the Continent. One after another they came, shattering teeth and bone on the islands' craggy shores...
reward_tree_skellige_story_pt2;But how is it the Skelligers have managed to ward off the Nilfgaardian armada, and incursions from Cidaris? Many attribute their failures to the fierce storms that shatter ship against rock. Little else gets Skelligers to chuckle as much as such excuses.
reward_tree_skellige_story_pt3;Skelligers are of a particular mindset. Can't swim in a storm? Go dawdle in the dirt. Can't brawl on a bluff? Then fiddle in a field.
reward_tree_skellige_story_pt4;Indeed, Skelligers are cut from a different cloth than their landlubbing counterparts on the Continent. They're more rugged, sturdy, more resistant to pain. And most importantly, rather than fear death, they await its glorious arrival.

reward_tree_svalblod_chest_1;The heart of the Svalblod cult was rooted at Fornhala, a settlement situated atop the nigh impassable mountains of Ard Skellig. After worship of the cruel idol became forbidden on the isles, the village's homes were deserted, its temples had fallen into disrepair. Yet those who have since stepped foot on the grounds of Fornhala – be they shepherds herding stray sheep or adventurers seeking shelter from a blizzard – have sworn by the gods upon their return of what they witnessed... Fresh blood glistening on altars to Svalblod and the roar of bears still echoing from caverns below...
reward_tree_svalblod_chest_2;Alas, the truth of the cult's survival struck the islanders in the harshest of ways. A feast at Kaer Trolde organized by Jarl Crach an Craite was violently interrupted by bloodsoaked massacre. Normally, for a feast to end in a brawl would come as no great surprise, perhaps even the preferred way to cap the night. Yet, in this case, several of the guests transformed into ferocious bears, eviscerating innocents. Fortunately, fate spared some lucky lives by delivering a seasoned witcher to the castle that very day...
reward_tree_svalblod_chest_3;The advent of the Crimson Curse emboldened Svalblod's fanatics. They emerged from hiding, worshipping their cruel god with newfound zeal. Many young warriors with dreams of glory and unstoppable strength succumb to the whispers of the cult's depraved druids and take part in their forbidden rituals. Jarls have convened to discuss whether to lead another raid into the mountains of Ard Skellig... Or to forget conflicts of the past and use the bear god's followers to defend Skellige against its foes.
reward_tree_svalblod_story_pt1;Skelligers hold a special reputation on the Continent for their cruelty. In truth, the folk of the isles do indeed revel in battle, in blood honorably spilt. Though as with all things, some live at an extreme, worshipping an idol who personifies the frenzy and remorseless cruelty of battle. He is called Svalblod.
reward_tree_svalblod_story_pt2;Svalblod is an incarnation of both man and bear in such a way that can give even the grizzliest Skelligers nightmares. His deformed body is not unlike a battlefield in itself where contradictory elements perpetually clash – a true embodiment of the grotesque.
reward_tree_svalblod_story_pt3;His acolytes would take a hallucinogenic decoction before heading deep within a cave at the heart of Ard Skellig. Once there, the cavern's bears would feast upon them alive. Then, like parasites, the cultists would seize control of the beasts' bodies.
reward_tree_svalblod_story_pt4;The jarls of the Skellige Isles at last decided to put an end to the practice. They seized Svalblod's followers, bound them to longships, and cast them out to the high sea without a sail to guide them. This was to be the final blow to eradicate the cult once and for all. Alas... It is not so easy to kill a god.

After all, what were these backwater lands in the greater scheme of Emhyr var Emreis' far-reaching ambitions?

reward_tree_unseen_elder_chest_1;Despite centuries of seclusion in his lair, the Unseen Elder knows Common Speech. Yet the few daring souls who have met him and survived warn of his dangerous impatience with conversation. Just one half-baked question, one lie... And his fangs are at your throat. All are powerless in such a circumstance – even those with the superhuman reflexes of a witcher.
reward_tree_unseen_elder_chest_2;On their honor, the residents of Toussaint swear that sometimes on calm, still nights, the waters of Lac Célavy carry strange, foreign whispers that make skin crawl and hair stand on end. It is the Unseen Elder, speaking to his brothers and sisters, counseling patience. For one day, the gates between the worlds will open again, and they shall at last return from whence then came.
reward_tree_unseen_elder_chest_3;Vampires regard the Unseen Elder with a fawning respect. Upon entering his presence, they bow deeply and bestow offerings. When the Unseen Elder makes demands of them, they subserviently carry out his wishes without a moment's hesitation. Is it not frightening to think what might happen should the Unseen Elder one day emerge from his lair into our world, unite an army of vampiric minions, and declare war on the human race? Well, certainly. Yet such an event is likely to never occur... Right?
reward_tree_unseen_elder_story_pt1;In the caverns beneath Toussaint, an aeons-old vampire patiently awaits the next Conjunction of the Spheres. His brethren call him the Unseen Elder, and mortals – well... One cannot name what one does not know to exist.
reward_tree_unseen_elder_story_pt2;The Unseen Elder craves not power, wealth nor even blood. His sole desire is to return to the world from which he has long been exile. For centuries he has watched the gate between worlds that now stands closed to him.
reward_tree_unseen_elder_story_pt3;Hanging silently from the cavern's ceiling, the Unseen Elder appears perfectly still as if plunged into a deep slumber, not unlike a bat in winter. Yet swift and terrifying danger awaits any who dare disturb his rest or threaten the gate between worlds.
reward_tree_unseen_elder_story_pt4;One word – enough for the Unseen Elder to demand obedience from any vampire. One movement – enough to slice a foe in two. As a general rule, it's best to give the caves beneath Toussaint a wide, wide berth.

reward_tree_usurper_chest_1;The Usurper did all he could to grant a semblance of legitimacy to his rule and strengthen his authority. In every major city he erected statues in his honor. He paid poets thousands of florens to craft works in praise of his magnificence, and instructed historians to unearth documentation proving that he was the illegitimate son of the Emperor Torres. Any who were foolish enough to make mention of his peasant origins would have their tongue removed by the Usurper's own hands.
reward_tree_usurper_chest_2;The Usurper's cruelty was legendary. He instituted strict military rule across the empire. Even the slightest offense was punishable by lashing, and more serious crimes either by mutiliation – or excruciating death. The Usurper had hoped these methods would bring order to an empire embroiled in chaos. Alas, the result was rather the opposite.
reward_tree_usurper_chest_3;Having secured his own power through murder, the Usurper placed a high value on spies and assassins. As a result, during his rule the Empire's intelligence apparatus rose to new heights, and alchemists concocted new, alarmingly effective poisons. Emhyr var Emreis criticized his predecessor's methods, calling them cruel and unbecoming of a ruler... Though, of course, he later made frequent use of them himself.
reward_tree_usurper_story_pt1;Not a lot is known about the Usurper – not even his name. His killer and successor, Emhyr var Emreis, made sure of that.
reward_tree_usurper_story_pt2;The Usurper was the lead conspirator in the plot to assassinate Fergus var Emreis... And to viciously torture the emperor's son and heir, Emhyr.
reward_tree_usurper_story_pt3;Yet, beyond that, how much is truly known? Allegedly, he was a man of the fields, a simple peasant by birth who rose to the rank of general through cunning and courage in battle. But, as the saying goes, the more you hold, the more you desire...

reward_tree_viper_2_chest;When master Ivar Evil-Eye instructed Kolgrim to look for the lost weapon diagrams that once belonged to their order, bad luck struck again. Although the witcher managed to find the legendary diagrams, he never returned to their keep.\nIn the small village of White Orchard, Kolgrim was accused of kidnapping the beekeeper’s son. The local baronet, wishing to appease the enraged people, called for a qualified torturer. Justice would be served, no matter what. Their justice, of course, so in response Kolgrim invoked Temerian common law, demanding a trial by ordeal. Surprisingly, the baronet agreed and ordered the witcher to cleanse his family crypt of wraiths.\nAccording to official sources, Kolgrim perished in the attempt. Yet rumors claimed otherwise. Some locals, enraged by the lordling’s decision, supposedly attacked the witcher before he even entered the crypt. The beekeeper had taken his rightful revenge, cutting the mutant’s head off with his own hands… Well, ‘twas just a rumor. But one thing became clear over time.\nIt was drowners that killed the missing boy. Not Kolgrim.
reward_tree_viper_2_story_pt1;Fate seemed to take pleasure in torturing Kolgrim. Fortune only smiled upon him if it was accompanied by a stroke of very bad luck. It was always thus, even before Kolgrim became a witcher. When he was still a young harmless brat…
reward_tree_viper_2_story_pt2;On the eve of Saovine small Kolgrim was kidnapped by a weeper, which replaced him with its own cursed offspring. Fortunately, the monster was slaughtered by a witcher that very same night. The boy’s savior, having taken pity on him, decided to escort him back home. Kolgrim was relieved to be returning to the warmth and safety of his mother, unaware of his impending misfortune.
reward_tree_viper_2_story_pt3;The woman greeted the witcher with hatred in her eyes, not believing a single word that came out of his mouth. Blinded by her contempt, she refused to even look twice at her own crying son, utterly convinced that the weeper’s baby was her real child. With the door slammed shut in their face, the witcher had no other choice than to take Kolgrim with him – straight to the Viper School.
reward_tree_viper_2_story_pt4;Over many future years, fate mocked Kolgrim many times – both during his murderous training and the later travels around the Continent. His life ended most ironically. For he, who was once stolen and then rejected from his mother, was accused of kidnapping a child.

reward_tree_viper_avatar_chest_1;Witchers have many weapons in their arsenal: swords both silver and steel, chains, daggers, and throwing knives. Two-handed weapons are uncommon for one simple reason – weight. But for Letho of Gulet, that was never an issue. He swung a two-handed blade with the same ease and speed that others enjoy when wielding a dagger or rapier.
reward_tree_viper_avatar_chest_2;The relationship between Letho and another legendary witcher, Geralt of Rivia, was rather... Complicated. At different points in time, each of them had both saved and threatened the other's life. But how did their odd story finally end? It depends on whom you ask. Some believe that Geralt killed Letho at the ruins of Loc Muinne, while others claim that the two had agreed to part ways in peace. Alas, the truth yet remains a mystery...
reward_tree_viper_avatar_chest_3;Letho was always aware of the impression he had upon others. He never raised his voice nor made threats, for there was no need. He knew his very appearance was enough to make the even the fiercest bandits shake in their boots. Letho also knew that he appeared to others as a dull-witted thug. Yet, despite possessing a superior intelligence, he made no attempt to challenge this impression. He knew people could be careless with their words if they thought they were speaking to a dumb sack of potatoes.
reward_tree_viper_avatar_story_pt1;Witcher training places great importance on endurance and agility rather than strength alone. After all, what good can a hulking mountain of muscle do against the lightning-fast strikes of a bruxa or striga... Right?
reward_tree_viper_avatar_story_pt2;Letho of Gulet was a witcher of the School of the Viper – an misleading association given his imposing stature. Though as large as a fiend and strong as a bull, his reflexes and agility rivaled those of other witchers... Making him an extremely formidable opponent.
reward_tree_viper_avatar_story_pt3;His prowess in combat would, indeed, have a major impact on the people of the Continent, for he struck down not one, but two leaders in the North... Yet, what could have led Letho from his path as a monster slayer to that of an assassin of kings?
reward_tree_viper_avatar_story_pt4;Letho was determined to reopen the fallen School of the Viper. To achieve his goal, he was prepared to enter any necessary alliance – the Empire included. Yet in the end, nothing came of his arrangement with Emhyr var Emreis, and fate showed once again that witchers should steer clear of politics...
reward_tree_viper_avatar_title;Letho of Gulet
reward_tree_viper_border_chest_1;The School of the Viper no longer exists, yet what exactly led to its demise is not precisely known. Most likely, it was closed by Emhyr var Emreis when he no longer found value in it. Knowing the emperor and his favored methods, one could reasonably suspect that the school's closure spelled a death sentence for every one of its members.
reward_tree_viper_border_chest_2;Today, weapons and armor from the Viper School are collectors' items for Vedyminaica enthusiasts – those who occupy themselves with the literature and history of the witcher profession. The owner of the largest collection of such relics was the Countess Mignole of Oxenfurt. Yet what compelled a highborn lady to take such a keen interest in monster hunters? She alone holds the answer.
reward_tree_viper_border_chest_3;Although witchers are hired to protect people from monsters, they are often repaid with distrust – even outright hostility. Kolgrim, a witcher from the Viper School, experienced such suspicion firsthand. While working on a contract in White Orchard, a local boy went missing. The villagers unanimously accused the witcher of abducting the child, and – ignoring his pleas of innocence – brought the witcher's life to a gruesome end. The townsfolk learned later that the boy had been killed by a drowner. Alas, it was too late for their judgment to be undone...
reward_tree_viper_border_story_pt1;It is oft said that witchers took on the characteristics of their schools' namesake creatures. Without a doubt, this was true of the Viper School. They were agile, quick, and frequently made use of deadly poisons.
reward_tree_viper_border_story_pt2;As with the other witcher schools – the Wolves' Kaer Morhen as sole exception – none were aware of the Viper School's location. Only one detail ever became widely known... That it stood somewhere south of the Yaruga. In Nilfgaard.
reward_tree_viper_border_story_pt3;Perhaps it's no wonder then that Vipers were less inclined to neutrality than other witchers. The Empire would never recognize such a stance. There is only obedient servant... Or mortal enemy.
reward_tree_viper_border_story_pt4;For this reason, few in the North were surprised to learn that the assassin of King Demavend III of Aedirn and King Foltest of Temeria wore a viper-shaped medallion – and that soon thereafter Nilfgaard readied itself for war.

reward_tree_voorhis_chest_1;Morvran Voorhis' greatest passion was horses. He could tell a Koviri pony from a Zerrikanian bay from just the clop of their hooves. It's said he could tame and ride a wild horse captured that very morning. To what did Voorhis owe his fascination with the beasts? He used to say that he preferred their company, for he found them to be far more honest than men...
reward_tree_voorhis_chest_2;Raised in the imperial court, Morvran Voorhis quickly developed the refinement of a courtier. He never missed a chance to compliment a lady of the court, knew the steps to every dance, and had sophisticated tastes for both wine and literature. Yet behind this facade, something unsettling lurked. His glazed, watery eyes were reminiscent of a zeugl's as it waits beneath the filth, poised to strike...
reward_tree_voorhis_chest_3;Voorhis ascended to the throne by way of conspiratorial plot. Thus, he understood the threat of hidden schemes, and once in power, he thought himself surrounded by conspirators and plotters. Pathologically paranoid, he never trusted his advisors, and punished even the smallest offenses with torture and death. As is often the case, his paranoia became a self-fulfilling prophecy. Rather than await their turn in the gallows, what remained of the aristocracy simply removed him from the throne...
reward_tree_voorhis_story_pt1;Morvran Voorhis often said he didn't need a sword to win a war. There was much truth in those words.
reward_tree_voorhis_story_pt2;At its core, Voorhis's strategy relied on spies, saboteurs, and provocateurs. There was little honor in it, perhaps, but none could deny its effectiveness.
reward_tree_voorhis_story_pt3;In preparation for war, Voorhis sent his enemies dozens of letters, the contents of which were full of clichéd ultimatums and hollow threats. What mattered most, however, was that his emissaries have a thorough look around and report back their findings...
reward_tree_voorhis_story_pt4;When war eventually broke out, Voorhis already knew precisely where to find enemy camps and supply lines, where prisoners were being held, and which enemy officers to intimidate, which to bribe... And of course, which of them were best dealt with by an assassin's blade

reward_tree_warrior_avatar_chest_1;While other officers of the Wild Hunt occupied their free time with pastimes of refined taste – such as Ge'els, who at every available opportunity put paint to canvas – Imlerith preferred the simple pleasures. Whenever the Red Riders halted their spectral raids, he set off for Bald Mountain to enjoy the company of the succubi who called it home...
reward_tree_warrior_avatar_chest_2;Imlerith was on intimate terms with the Crones from Crookback Bog. Through their magic he acquired tremendous strength. Each time he visited the Ladies of the Wood, they offered him acorns from the mountain's ancient oak, cooked for three days and nights in children's blood. It was this macabre nut that granted him great power... And twisted his mind.
reward_tree_warrior_avatar_chest_3;Imlerith had many lives on his conscience... If "conscience" is even the proper term. Among them was a certain witcher from the School of the Wolf, whose name I struggle to put to paper... The mere thought of his death at the hands of that Aen Elle barbarian boils my blood. The inquisitive reader can no doubt learn his identity from other sources...
reward_tree_warrior_avatar_story_pt1;The term "elven warrior" brings to mind a lithe, acrobatic swordsmaster in light armor, slicing surgically at arteries with the very tip of an elegant blade. Imlerith was a different sort of elven warrior...
reward_tree_warrior_avatar_story_pt2;Clad head to toe in hulking plate armor, this elf charged fearlessly into battle, pulverizing his foes into a bloody pulp with an immense two-handed mace. As bones cracked and blood splattered, a grotesque, twisted laugther could be heard from behind his helm.
reward_tree_warrior_avatar_story_pt3;Imlerith's fighting technique was far from subtle, but proved undeniably effective. The ferocious elf wreaked havoc on the battlefield, rarely encountering any who could stand as his equal.
reward_tree_warrior_avatar_story_pt4;Though in time, he would eventually meet his match in Geralt of Rivia, the White Wolf. Their duel was long and arduous, but in the end it was Imlerith who fell – his face scorched by the witcher's Igni Sign.

reward_tree_warrior_border_chest_1;The Continent has endured countless conflicts, yet by far its most devastating war was between the fractured kingdoms of the North and united front of the Nilfgaardian Empire from the South. Although the North and South had already waged three wars against each other, laying waste to vast swathes of the Continent, their feud was far from settled. Once one side eventually succumbs to the other, the Pontar and the Yaruga will run red with blood.
reward_tree_warrior_border_chest_2;Still to this day, the Battle of Brenna during the Second Northern War was the largest battle in the Continent's history. More than forty thousand soldiers fought for both the Northern and Southern sides: light and heavy infantry, mercenaries, elven cavalry, dwarven shieldbearers... Yet it was one man who ultimately determined the battle's outcome – Lamarr Flaut, a Nilfgaardian officer who, during his reconnaissance, failed to notice thousands of infantrymen in the North's reserve. An oversight that proved Nilfgaard's demise.
reward_tree_warrior_border_chest_3;One of the Continent's most highly regarded war historians was a certain Jarre of Ellander. His descriptions of battles left no want for detail, yet spared superfluous embellishments and patriotic rhetoric. In his retellings, he does not describe war as a simple series of honorable skirmishes, but a savage and chaotic slaughter. Jarre's unique perspective might have something to do with his own military service, where he not only bore witness to the atrocities firsthand, but was personally marred by them – forever losing an arm.
reward_tree_warrior_border_story_pt1;The arrival of spring is greeted with mixed feelings by inhabitants of the Continent. On the one hand, the melting snow spells an end to hunger, but on the other – it heralds the coming of yet more war.
reward_tree_warrior_border_story_pt2;War is an inherent factor of life on the Continent. Year after year, rulers attempt to extend their borders, raid lands unfamiliar. Yet with every battle, the number of their subjects dwindles more and more...
reward_tree_warrior_border_story_pt3;For generations, scholars, mages, and priests have called on leaders to lay down their arms and put an end to this cycle of slaughter. If they do not cease, these experts warn, the Continent will plunge into an era far darker and more terrible than the times following the Conjunction of the Spheres.

reward_tree_wild_boar_chest_1;The combative, warrior-like nature of boars makes them them a popular choice in heraldry. They appear most infamously on the von Everec coat of arms from which Olgierd, the leader of the Redanian Free Company, is descended. And contrary to what some landlocked folk on the Continent would have you believe, the Wild Boar of the Sea is the moniker given to Skelligan jarl Crach an Craite and his longship. There are no known varieties of boar indigenous to the waters of the Great Sea.
reward_tree_wild_boar_story_pt1;The boar is a woodland creature, and an ornery, aggressive one at that. On the outskirts of Kaedwen, a rumor circulates that the beasts have a taste for virgin blood... Of course, the truth is much simpler: boars are perfectly content with vegetables – even just a few earthy carrots.
reward_tree_wild_boar_story_pt2;Mother nature endowed the boar with two pairs of sharp, protruding tusks – the upper and lower canines. Truly, a formidable beast. Woe betide any who encounters a wild boar in the forest and has difficulty climbing trees...
reward_tree_wild_boar_story_pt3;Boars have a firm, elongated snout that somewhat resembles a flute, though of course, sadly, cannot be used as such.

reward_tree_wild_boar_story_pt4;The boar differs from the pig not only in the thickness of its bristles, but also in its disposition. Pigs are timid, easily spooked, whereas boars readily stand their ground. Even their grunts sound more hostile, as if to say, "Find your own potatoes, arsehole."

reward_tree_wild_hunt_2_story_chest;When the elf sage lost the battle with the White Frost, she escaped to the new world of the Aen Elle, opening the gates on her own—because it was not only her appearance and behaviour that had changed. A power awoke within her, thanks to which she was able to bend time and space to her will. Later on, this power made her the first Navigator, as well as the leader of the Wild Hunt, and gave rise to the legend of the Queen of Winter.\nAccording to the story, the Queen was supposed to traverse the sky during a blizzard, scattering hard, sharp pieces of ice all around. And woe to he who caught a shard in the eye or the heart. For such a person was forever lost, abandoning everything to relentlessly pursue his beloved Queen, and unable to ever reach her, perished of longing.
reward_tree_wild_hunt_2_story_pt1;Even the early generals of the Wild Hunt had no idea how many centuries their Queen had already lived. But elves joked that she was as old as the world—the very one which the Aen Elle had abandoned when the White Frost came.

Capable of bending time and space, he could disappear in a blink – only to suddenly reappear behind his opponent to deliver a swift, killing blow. Few have faced him and survived... And all of them wore witcher medallions round their necks.
reward_tree_wild_hunt_avatar_chest_3;This elite navigator of the Wild Hunt rarely breaks his silence, yet when he does, he limits himself to a scant few words. But why? Perhaps because he views the world differently than other mortals. Countless times Caranthir has witnessed dimensions collide. He has heard the sound of time rushing by and the crunch of bending space. Our languages are likely incapable of describing such otherworldly experiences, and perhaps that is why he forsook them.
reward_tree_wild_hunt_avatar_story_pt1;Interdimensional travel is no simple feat: biting cold, twisting timelines, the folding and tangling fabrics of space. For these reasons, the Wild Hunt was in need of an exceptional navigator – one such as Caranthir Ar-Feiniel.

Or perhaps they existed even before the rise of the Wild Hunt, beings born of magic and eternal frost, trapped between dimensions?
reward_tree_wild_hunt_border_chest_2;In rare instances, an unfortunate soul abducted by the Wild Hunt has found their way home. Yet the survivor comes to realize that centuries have passed since their disappearance – the graves of loved ones are weathered and covered in moss, their dwellings are derelict or long since destroyed. Driven mad from despair, physically and mentally broken from their murderous toil, they wander the Continent, reciting their tale of captivity to any who listens. Yet by what means did they escape? A secret passage between the worlds? Or, perhaps more likely, the Aen Elle allowed them to leave, to spread fear among the people of the Continent...
reward_tree_wild_hunt_border_chest_3;Though the decision to create the Wild Hunt was ultimately made by the king of the Aen Elle, Auberon Muircetach, the architect behind the idea was an elven sage known as Avallac'h. It was he who began the genetic experiments that led to the birth of navigators – elves capable of creating safe passage between open dimensional gates – and he who developed the necessary spells. Then, when his work was finished and the Hunt took to the skies, Avallac'h realized he had created a monster.
reward_tree_wild_hunt_border_story_pt1;The Aen Elle are elves who are convinced of their own racial superiority. They believed that the hard, filthy labor required on their vast estates was suited only for other, inferior races. For their wish to become reality, the Wild Hunt was born.
reward_tree_wild_hunt_border_story_pt2;Riders of the Wild Hunt abducted individuals from all races: humans, dwarves, and even their cousins – the Aen Seidhe elves. Apparently, when work needs doing, one cannot afford to be picky...
reward_tree_wild_hunt_border_story_pt3;Yet why all this newfound drive and effort to tend to their lands? Quite simply, the world of the Aen Elle was dying – growing ever colder and ever darker. For their increasingly frozen, barren land to bear fruit, it required the fertilization of sweat and blood.
reward_tree_wild_hunt_border_story_pt4;And so the raids of the Wild Hunt raged on, the spectral cavalcade leaving deserted villages in its wake. The riders could never rest, for should their duty end, so too would their world.

reward_tree_wolf_2_story_chest;For many, the phrase "with age comes wisdom" often doesn't apply, but for Vesemir, it is surely the case. However, it was not the numerous punishments imposed on him by Barmin that ended his disobedience, but the harsh reality of consequences⁠—specifically, when others had to pay the price for his sins. When his nighttime indulgences ended up costing the life of someone he promised to defend... Well, that was enough to change the witcher's ways. And with each preventable death he witnessed, he became more and more serious, year after year, until he took on the role of fencing master at Kaer Morhen. Famous for his extensive knowledge and rigorous approach to training, he ensured his young witcher adepts were thoroughly disciplined⁠—for their own good, and the well-being of those they would later have to protect.
reward_tree_wolf_2_story_pt1;Though it is hard to believe now, Vesemir was once young. After his Trial of Grasses, he was still trying to grow his first beard. Fortunately, he was completely unscathed by the murderous training he underwent⁠—collecting no scars nor deformations. Apart from the colour of his eyes, nothing about his appearance betrayed the witcher mutations.
reward_tree_wolf_2_story_pt2;Thus, when the young Vesemir⁠—together with master Barmin⁠—set out on the trail for the first time, he found a simple way to hide his provenance. He wore a wide-brimmed hat. The one and only that became Papa Vesemir's famous hat, which no other witcher was allowed to wear, especially Lambert.
reward_tree_wolf_2_story_pt3;Donning his voluminous cloak and favourite hat, young Vesemir sneaked out under Barmin's \nnose to devote himself to activities frowned upon by his mentor. In short, he wandered around the local pubs, took part in every possible party and wedding, or climbed the balconies of various mansions to reach one of the court ladies' bedrooms. As for the houses of ill repute... Suffice to say that Vesemir visited more of them in his long life than Eskel, Lambert and Geralt combined.
reward_tree_wolf_2_story_pt4;And master Barmin, well… Sometimes he turned a blind eye to the actions of his unruly student, but more often he scolded young Vesemir and gave him some extremely boring, time-consuming task as punishment. Like polishing swords, for example.
reward_tree_wolf_2_title;Vesemir
reward_tree_wolf_avatar_chest_1;Did you know that Geralt of Rivia did not, in fact, hail from Rivia? Having been an orphan, he adopted the by-name in place of the surname he never had. Initially, the witcher had planned to dub himself Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde, but his mentor, Vesemir, in a few short yet sharp words, convinced him it might not be the best idea. And rightfully so!
reward_tree_wolf_avatar_chest_2;Geralt had the custom of giving all his horses the very same name – Roach – no matter whether stallion or mare. And every steed which bore the name was exceptionally well-mannered. One whistle and the horse would appear right at his side. That is, given that there weren't any obstacles in the way...
reward_tree_wolf_avatar_chest_3;At every opportunity – even if the situation hadn't called for it – Geralt expressed his hatred for portals. A perfectly reasonable attitude given that portals are not the safest means of transport, despite what mages would have you believe. It's not uncommon for a traveler to experience nausea and headaches after emerging from a portal – even to emerge in an entirely unexpected location. Or, indeed, fail to emerge at all.
reward_tree_wolf_avatar_story_pt1;Does such a man truly need introduction? Well, for those living under a rock, I present to you Geralt of Rivia – witcher from the School of the Wolf, known to elves and dryads as Gwynbleidd, the greatest swordsman of the North. Behold the White Wolf – a true legend for the ages.
reward_tree_wolf_avatar_story_pt2;Geralt's list of feats seems to go on without end. It was he who lifted the curse that plagued Princess Adda of Temeria, expelled the djinn from the city of Rinde, and slew the King of the Wild Hunt. Yet was there anything from his life of which he was most proud?
reward_tree_wolf_avatar_story_pt3;Indeed, there was – being a good father to Ciri. He taught her everything he knew, surrounded her with love, and gave her support in their most difficult times. When Ciri's circumstances were most dire and she sought him out for help, Geralt never let her down.
reward_tree_wolf_avatar_story_pt4;For you see, though Geralt of Rivia had survived the Trial of the Grasses, possessed superhuman reflexes and catlike eyes, and was on first-name terms with kings, his desire in life was quite simple. He wished to be with people he loved – and to have all others leave him be.
reward_tree_wolf_avatar_title;Geralt of Rivia
reward_tree_wolf_border_chest_1;Following a massacre from decades past, Kaer Morhen was besieged yet again – this time by Salamandra, a secretive and powerful criminal organization, which at these times shook the underworld of Temeria and Redania to its core. Although the witchers managed to defend their home, they failed to prevent the theft of their witcher mutagens. The consequences of their failure were evident before long...
reward_tree_wolf_border_chest_2;The Wolf School's obstacle course on which witchers-in-training honed their balance and endurance was commonly called "The Gauntlet." As you might surmise from its name, the exercises on this trail proved an extreme challenge. Ambitious, young witcher lads were made to perform pirouettes on a narrow beams, dodge massive, spiked logs, and duel with mobile sparring dummies... Oh, and while blindfolded.
reward_tree_wolf_border_chest_3;Every witcher from the School of the Wolf wears a silver medallion in that predator's image. Not only do they serve as an identifying marker of the school, but also as a protective amulet. The magic-imbued pendant vibrates and hums when its owner draws close to a Place of Power... Or a dangerous monster.
reward_tree_wolf_border_story_pt1;Of all the witcher schools, the School of the Wolf is most widely recognized. Its notoriety is due largely to its most famous member, one Geralt of Rivia... Yet, is also due in part to Kaer Morhen's tragic past.
reward_tree_wolf_border_story_pt2;This fortress, situated at the edge of the world, tucked away in the mountains of Kaedwen, had served throughout the ages as the home for witchers of the Wolf School. At one time, dozens had lived there... Today, you could count its living members on the fingers of one hand.
reward_tree_wolf_border_story_pt3;For years upon years, witchers have been ostracized and vilified by humans. And yet, rather than quash false rumors and gossip, they bided their time, convinced their actions would speak louder than words. When, one fateful day, a frenzied mob assembled before their gate, they had realized their error. By then, however, it was already too late.
reward_tree_wolf_border_story_pt4;Today, the fortress of Kaer Morhen lies in ruin. Its towers are slowly crumbling, its walls are collapsing, the roofs have given way to rot. The Wolf School's last remaining witchers still try to keep their home intact – yet without any real conviction. They know their time has all but passed.

scoia_fluff_description;The Continent was once ruled by elves, dwarves, and gnomes – known to most as the Elder Races. Yet humans have since driven them to desolate mountain ranges and dense woodlands. Their last remaining scraps of land are wrested from them as they are left to perish of hunger and disease. Some elves and dwarves, however, seek a different death – their hands not empty, but wet in human blood. With squirrel tails pinned to their caps and belts, they prowl the roadsides, eager to kill any dh'oine who crosses their path. The Scoia'tael shall never claim lasting victory over their oppressors, a fact they well know. Yet rather than dampen their spirits, their resolve to resist has never proved stronger. After all, they've nothing left to lose.

ske_fluff_description;Several hundred miles off the Continent's western coast lie the Skellige Isles. Compared to the Northern Realms and the Nilfgaardian Empire, they appear as mere inkblots on the map. How could it be that they remain unconquered? Well, the truth is... Many have tried. Shipwrecks of enemy fleets litter the coasts, and Skelligan warriors drink mead from their foes' rusted helms. Yet, for decades now, no outside force has sailed against the isles, a reality which has the islanders worried. After all, without the crucible of battle, how can they find glory and secure their place at the table of their ancestors? They've no choice but to board their longships, regale in song, and set sail for fertile lands across stormy seas, in search of plunder and blood...

syn_fluff_description;Some fight for honor, others for empire. Some fight for king, others for freedom. The members of the Syndicate fight for but one purpose – wealth. If you've the means to afford their services, they will perform whatever deed you require... No matter how heinous. In the criminal underworld, it is through crime you build your reputation and fill your purse. While the city's economy thrives on the Novigradian Crown, its underbelly revolves around coin of a different sort. When exchanged as payment, an inviolable pact has been sealed. And those foolish enough to break it shall be hunted down and forced to pay a far greater price.
